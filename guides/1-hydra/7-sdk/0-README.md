# SDK

All SDKs are use automated code generation provided by [`swagger-codegen`](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen).
Unfortunately, `swagger-codegen` has serious breaking changes in the generated code when upgrading versions. Therefore,
we do not make backwards compatibility promises with regards to the generated SDKs. We hope to improve this process
in the future.
