# 5 Minute Tutorial

To get started quickly, we provide a Docker Compose based example for setting up ORY Hydra, a PostgreSQL instance
and an exemplary user login & consent app. You need to have the latest Docker as well as Docker Compose version installed.

Next, clone (`git clone https://github.com/ory/hydra.git`), [download](https://github.com/ory-am/hydra/archive/master.zip),
or use `go get -d github.com/ory/hydra` - if you have Go (1.10+) installed on you system - to download the Docker Compose
set up.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/ory/hydra.git
$ cd hydra
$ git checkout tags/v1.0.0-beta.2
$ docker-compose -p hydra up --build
Starting hydra_mysqld_1
Starting hydra_postgresd_1
Starting hydra_hydra_1

[...]
```

Everything should running now! Let's confirm that everything is working by creating our first OAuth 2.0 Client.
The following commands will use Docker wizardry. You can obviously install the ORY Hydra CLI locally and avoid using
Docker here. If you do use the CLI locally, you can omit `docker exec -it hydra_hydra_1 \` completely.

Please be aware that docker-compose sets up a port `4445`. If you use a locally available ORY Hydra CLI, the command
`hydra token user` will fail because it also needs to listen on port `4445`. There is currently no workaround for that
in this example, so please use `docker` for that specific command.

```
# Creates a new OAuth 2.0 client
$ docker exec -it hydra_hydra_1 \
    hydra clients create \
    --endpoint http://localhost:4444 \
    --id my-client \
    --secret secret \
    -g client_credentials

OAuth2 client id: my-client
OAuth2 client secret: secret

# Let's perform the client credentials grant.
$ docker exec -it hydra_hydra_1 \
    hydra token client \
    --endpoint http://localhost:4444 \
    --client-id my-client \
    --client-secret secret

# Let's perform token introspection on that token. Make sure to copy the token you just got and not the dummy value.
$ docker exec -it hydra_hydra_1 \
    hydra token introspect \
    --endpoint http://localhost:4444 \
    --client-id my-client \
    --client-secret secret \
    UDYMha9TwsMBejEvKfnDOXkhgkLsnmUNYVQDklT5bD8.ZNpuNRC85erbIYDjPqhMwTinlvQmNTk_UvttcLQxFJY

{
        "active": true,
        "client_id": "my-client",
        "exp": 1527078658,
        "iat": 1527075058,
        "iss": "http://localhost:4444",
        "sub": "my-client",
        "token_type": "access_token"
}
```

Next, we will perform the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Grant. For that, we must first create a client that is capable
of performing that grant:

```
$ docker exec -it hydra_hydra_1 \
    hydra clients create \
    --endpoint http://localhost:4444 \
    --id auth-code-client \
    --secret secret \
    --grant-types authorization_code,refresh_token \
    --response-types code,id_token \
    --scope openid,offline \
    --callbacks http://127.0.0.1:4445/callback
```

The next command sets up an example application that will request an access token from ORY Hydra:

```
$ docker exec -it hydra_hydra_1 \
    hydra token user \
    --client-id auth-code-client \
    --client-secret secret \
    --endpoint http://localhost:4444/ \
    --scope openid,offline

Setting up home route on http://127.0.0.1:4445/
Setting up callback listener on http://127.0.0.1:4445/callback
Press ctrl + c on Linux / Windows or cmd + c on OSX to end the process.
If your browser does not open automatically, navigate to:

        http://127.0.0.1:4445/
```

Open the URL `http://127.0.0.1:4445/`, log in, and authorize the application. Next, you should see at least an access token in the response.
If you granted the `offline` scope, you will also see a refresh token. If you granted the `openid` scope, you will get an ID Token as well.

Great! You installed hydra, connected the CLI, created a client and completed two authentication flows!
Before you continue, clean up this set up in order to avoid conflicts with other tutorials form this guide:

```
$ docker-compose kill
$ docker-compose rm -f
```
