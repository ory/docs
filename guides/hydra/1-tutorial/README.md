# 5 Minute Tutorial

To get started quickly, we provide a Docker Compose based example for setting up ORY Hydra, a PostgreSQL instance
and an exemplary user login & consent app. You need to have the latest Docker as well as Docker Compose version installed.

Next, clone (`git clone https://github.com/ory/hydra.git`), [download](https://github.com/ory-am/hydra/archive/master.zip),
or use `go get -d github.com/ory/hydra` - if you have Go (1.10+) installed on you system - to download the Docker Compose
set up.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/ory/hydra.git
$ cd hydra
$ git checkout tags/v1.0.0-beta.8

$ docker-compose -p hydra up --build
Starting hydra_mysqld_1
Starting hydra_postgresd_1
Starting hydra_hydra_1

[...]
```


Everything should running now! Let's confirm that everything is working by creating our first OAuth 2.0 Client.
The following commands will use Docker wizardry. You can obviously install the ORY Hydra CLI locally and avoid using
Docker here. If you do use the CLI locally, you can omit `docker exec -it hydra_hydra_1 \` completely.

You will notice that two ports are being used. Port `4444` and port `4445`. The former is for request to ORY Hydra's public
endpoints. The latter to its administrative endpoints. For more information on this, head over to
[Securing ORY Hydra](../2-environment/securing-ory-hydra.md). If you want to run ORY Hydra admin and
public services in two separate containers, run

```
$ docker-compose -p hydra -f docker-compose-twoc.yml up --build
```

Please be aware that you will not be able to run the hydra CLI from within docker if you
use the docker-compose-twoc.yml file. Instead, you must install the CLI locally and
omit `docker exec -it hydra_hydra_1 \` from your commands.

Ok, let's continue by creating a new OAuth 2.0 Client.

```
# Creates a new OAuth 2.0 client
$ docker exec -it hydra_hydra_1 \
    hydra clients create \
    --endpoint http://localhost:4445 \
    --id my-client \
    --secret secret \
    -g client_credentials

OAuth2 client id: my-client
OAuth2 client secret: secret

# Let's perform the client credentials grant.
$ docker exec -it hydra_hydra_1 \
    hydra token client \
    --endpoint http://localhost:4444 \
    --client-id my-client \
    --client-secret secret

UDYMha9TwsMBejEvKfnDOXkhgkLsnmUNYVQDklT5bD8.ZNpuNRC85erbIYDjPqhMwTinlvQmNTk_UvttcLQxFJY

# Let's perform token introspection on that token. Make sure to copy the token you just got and not the dummy value.
$ docker exec -it hydra_hydra_1 \
    hydra token introspect \
    --endpoint http://localhost:4445 \
    --client-id my-client \
    --client-secret secret \
    UDYMha9TwsMBejEvKfnDOXkhgkLsnmUNYVQDklT5bD8.ZNpuNRC85erbIYDjPqhMwTinlvQmNTk_UvttcLQxFJY

{
        "active": true,
        "client_id": "my-client",
        "exp": 1527078658,
        "iat": 1527075058,
        "iss": "http://localhost:4444",
        "sub": "my-client",
        "token_type": "access_token"
}
```

Next, we will perform the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Grant. For that, we must first create a client that is capable
of performing that grant:

```
$ docker exec -it hydra_hydra_1 \
    hydra clients create \
    --endpoint http://localhost:4445 \
    --id auth-code-client \
    --secret secret \
    --grant-types authorization_code,refresh_token \
    --response-types code,id_token \
    --scope openid,offline \
    --callbacks http://127.0.0.1:5555/callback
```

Note that you need to add `--token-endpoint-auth-method none` if your clients are public (such as SPA apps and native apps) because the public clients could not provide client secret.


The next command starts a server that serves an example web application. The application will perform the OAuth 2.0
Authorization Code Flow using ORY Hydra. The web server runs on [http://127.0.0.1:5555](http://127.0.0.1:5555).

```
$ docker exec -it hydra_hydra_1 \
    hydra token user \
    --client-id auth-code-client \
    --client-secret secret \
    --endpoint http://localhost:4444/ \
    --port 5555 \
    --scope openid,offline

Setting up home route on http://127.0.0.1:4445/
Setting up callback listener on http://127.0.0.1:4445/callback
Press ctrl + c on Linux / Windows or cmd + c on OSX to end the process.
If your browser does not open automatically, navigate to:

        http://127.0.0.1:5555/
```

Open the URL [http://127.0.0.1:5555/](http://127.0.0.1:5555/), log in, and authorize the application. Next, you should
see at least an access token in the response. If you granted the `offline` scope, you will also see a refresh token.
If you granted the `openid` scope, you will get an ID Token as well.

Great! You installed hydra, connected the CLI, created a client and completed two authentication flows!
Before you continue, clean up this set up in order to avoid conflicts with other tutorials form this guide:

```
$ docker-compose kill
$ docker-compose rm -f
```
