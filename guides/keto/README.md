# Introduction

Welcome to the ORY Keto documentation!

ORY Keto is a service that stores permissions and can answer if an identity is allowed to perform a certain action over
REST. If you came here to answer

* if a certain user is allowed to modify e.g. a blog article
* if a robot is allowed to e.g. print a document

you have come to the right place. If you came here, because your permission system involves

* complex multi-tenant environments
* permissions based on ownership, ip address, time of day
* or other advanced uses

you are the right place even more so.
