### Access Control Policies

Access Control Policies are a way of authorizing requests. Alternatives are Role Based Access
Control, Access Control Lists, Discretionary Access Control, and others.

Access Control Policies are provided by the Ladon SDK and while Access Control Policies are not standardized,
we analyzed various popular Access Control Policy Mechanisms such as AWS IAM or Google IAM and
modeled Ladon after those.

The Ladon SDK has seen adoption across various Go projects, yields good test coverage and includes a magnitude
of test cases for the vital parts of the library. The API has not seen any breaking changes or security
issues since its inception.
