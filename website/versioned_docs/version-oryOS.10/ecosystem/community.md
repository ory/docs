ORY is possible because of a unique, experienced, and dedicated community. Sponsors, contributors, and adopters make this
ecosystem possible and shape it in significant ways.

Important community resources include [GitHub](), [Discord (chat)]() and [Discourse (forum)]().

## Community Projects

Members of the ORY community have built technology, written blog posts, and published open source software that extends
or modifies the core technology. This is a list of those.
