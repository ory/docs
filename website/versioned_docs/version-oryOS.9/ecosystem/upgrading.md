Good software improves over time. If it wouldn't, you shouldn't use it. Unfortunately, some of these improvements
have breaking changes. We know that breaking changes are annoying so we want to make upgrading as painless as possible.

We document detailed changelogs and upgrade guides for this very reason:

- ORY Hydra: [upgrade guide](https://github.com/ory/hydra/blob/master/UPGRADE.md), [changelog](https://github.com/ory/hydra/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)
- ORY Oathkeeper: [upgrade guide](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/blob/master/UPGRADE.md), [changelog](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)
- ORY Keto: [upgrade guide](https://github.com/ory/keto/blob/master/UPGRADE.md), [changelog](https://github.com/ory/keto/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

Before upgrading to a newer version, please make sure to check with these documents first.
