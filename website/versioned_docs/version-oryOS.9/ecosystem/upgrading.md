Good software improves over time. If it wouldn't, you shouldn't use it.
Unfortunately, some of these improvements have breaking changes. We know that
breaking changes are annoying so we want to make upgrading as painless as
possible.

We document detailed changelogs and upgrade guides for this very reason:

- ORY Hydra:
  [upgrade guide](https://github.com/ory/hydra/blob/master/UPGRADE.md),
  [changelog](https://github.com/ory/hydra/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)
- ORY Oathkeeper:
  [upgrade guide](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/blob/master/UPGRADE.md),

- ORY Keto: [upgrade guide](https://github.com/ory/keto/blob/master/UPGRADE.md),
  [changelog](https://github.com/ory/keto/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)
