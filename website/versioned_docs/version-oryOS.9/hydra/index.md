Welcome to the Hydra documentation. This documentation will

1. teach you what OAuth2 and OpenID Connect are and how ORY Hydra fits in the picture.
2. help you run a ORY Hydra installation on your system using Docker.
3. teach you how to install, configure, run and use ORY Hydra.

Let us begin with the first part, understanding what OAuth2 and OpenID Connect are.

## What is ORY Hydra?

ORY Hydra is an OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect Provider. As such, it is capable of issuing access, refresh, and ID Tokens.
Contrary to other projects out there, ORY Hydra does not offer user management (login, logout, profile management,
registration) but instead uses a redirection-based flow and a REST API to delegate user authentication (login) to
a service which you implement and control. This allows you to build a user management that works for you, with the frontend
technology that you like, and authentication mechanisms required by your use case (e.g. token-based 2FA, SMS 2FA).

As such, ORY Hydra is the most flexible OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect provider out there and gives you great freedom
in implementing your business logic, and still getting all the benefits from OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect.

Additional to the OAuth 2.0 functionality, ORY Hydra offers a safe storage for cryptographic keys (e.g. for signing JSON Web Tokens)
and is capable of managing OAuth 2.0 Clients.

ORY Hydra is OpenID Connect certified (pending) and implements all the requirements stated by the OpenID Foundation. As such,
it correctly implements the different OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect flows as intended by the IETF and OpenID Foundation.

## Introduction to OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect

This section will give you some ideas of what OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect 1.0 are for. If you
already know what OAuth2 and OpenID Connect are and how they work, you can skip to the next [Section](#introduction-to-hydra).
This section will not explain how the various flows of OAuth2 work and how they look like. We strongly recommend
to read the following articles:

* [DigitalOcean: An Introduction to OAuth 2](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-oauth-2)
* [Aaron Parecki: OAuth2 Simplified](https://aaronparecki.com/2012/07/29/2/oauth2-simplified)
* [Zapier: Chapter 5: Authentication, Part 2](https://zapier.com/learn/apis/chapter-5-authentication-part-2/)

Please be aware that we do not aim to explain OAuth 2.0 in great detail. We assume that you have some knowledge
of the flows and strongly encourage you to refresh your knowledge with the articles listed above.

### What is OAuth 2.0?

[The OAuth 2.0 authorization framework](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) is a memo in the
[Request for Comments](https://www.ietf.org/rfc.html) document series published by the
IETF Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). Memos in the Requests for Comments (RFC) document series
contain technical and organizational notes about the Internet. They cover many aspects of computer
networking, including protocols, procedures, programs, and concepts [...].

The OAuth 2.0 authorization framework enables a third-party
application to obtain limited access to an HTTP service, either on
behalf of a resource owner by orchestrating an approval interaction
between the resource owner and the HTTP service, or by allowing the
third-party application to obtain access on its own behalf.

In the traditional client-server authentication model, the client
requests an access-restricted resource (protected resource) on the
server by authenticating with the server using the resource owner's
credentials. In order to provide third-party applications access to
restricted resources, the resource owner shares its credentials with
the third party. This creates several problems and limitations.

OAuth addresses these issues by introducing an authorization layer
and separating the role of the client from that of the resource
owner.  In OAuth, the client requests access to resources controlled
by the resource owner and hosted by the resource server, and is
issued a different set of credentials than those of the resource
owner.

Instead of using the resource owner's credentials to access protected
resources, the client obtains an access token -- a string denoting a
specific scope, lifetime, and other access attributes.  Access tokens
are issued to third-party clients by an authorization server with the
approval of the resource owner.  The client uses the access token to
access the protected resources hosted by the resource server.

Source: [IETF RFC 6749](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749)

### OAuth 2.0 Example

An end-user (resource owner) can grant a printing
service (client) access to her protected photos stored at a photo-
sharing service (resource server), without sharing her username and
password with the printing service.  Instead, she authenticates
directly with a server trusted by the photo-sharing service
(authorization server), which issues the printing service delegation-
specific credentials (access token).

### What is OpenID Connect 1.0?

OpenID Connect 1.0 is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol.
It enables Clients to verify the identity of the End-User based on the authentication performed
by an Authorization Server, as well as to obtain basic profile information about the End-User in
an interoperable and REST-like manner.

As background, the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework and OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token
Usage specifications provide a general framework for third-party
applications to obtain and use limited access to HTTP resources.
They define mechanisms to obtain and use Access Tokens to access resources
but do not define standard methods to provide identity information.
Notably, without profiling OAuth 2.0, it is incapable of providing information
about the authentication of an End-User.

OpenID Connect implements authentication as an extension to the OAuth 2.0 authorization process.

Source [OpenID Connect Core 1.0](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html)

OpenID Connect allows clients of all types, including Web-based, mobile, and JavaScript clients,
to request and receive information about authenticated sessions and end-users. The specification
suite is extensible, allowing participants to use optional features such as encryption of identity data,
discovery of OpenID Providers, and session management, when it makes sense for them.

There are different work flows for OpenID Connect 1.0, we recommend checking out the OpenID Connect sandbox at
[openidconnect.net](https://openidconnect.net/).

## Introduction to Hydra

Hydra is a server implementation of the OAuth 2.0 authorization framework and the OpenID Connect Core 1.0. Existing OAuth2
implementations usually ship as libraries or SDKs such as [node-oauth2-server](https://github.com/oauthjs/node-oauth2-server)
or [fosite](https://github.com/ory/fosite), or as fully featured identity solutions with user
management and user interfaces, such as [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) or [Okta](https://www.okta.com/).

Implementing and using OAuth2 without understanding the whole specification is challenging and prone to errors, even when
SDKs are being used. The primary goal of Hydra is to make OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect 1.0 less painful to set up and easier to use.

Hydra implements the flows described in OAuth2 and OpenID Connect 1.0 without forcing you to use a "Hydra User Management"
or some template engine or a predefined front-end. Instead it relies on HTTP redirection and cryptographic methods
to verify user consent allowing you to use Hydra with any authentication endpoint, be it [authboss](https://github.com/go-authboss/authboss),
[auth0.com](https://auth0.com/) or your proprietary PHP authentication.

Hydra incorporates best practices in the area of the web service technology:

1. Hydra ships as a single binary for all popular platforms including Linux, OSX and Windows, without any additional
dependencies. For further simplicity, Hydra is available as a [Docker Image](https://hub.docker.com/r/oryd/hydra/).
2. Hydra is built security first: architecture and work flows are designed to neutralize various common (OWASP TOP TEN)
and uncommon attack vectors. [Learn more](https://www.ory.sh/docs/guides/master/hydra/5-security/).
3. Hydra has a low CPU and memory footprint, short start up times and a CLI with developers in mind.
4. Hydra scales effortlessly up and down on every platform imaginable, including Heroku, Cloud Foundry, Docker,
Google Container Engine and many more.

Hydra has a limitations too:

1. Hydra is not something that manages user accounts. Hydra does not offer user registration, password reset, user
login, sending confirmation emails. This is what the *Identity Provider* is responsible for.
The communication between Hydra and the Identity Provider is called [*Login and Consent Flow*](hydra/oauth2.md).
2. If you are building a simple service for 50-100 registered users, OAuth2 and Hydra will probably be too sophisticated.
3. Hydra will not support the OAuth2 resource owner password credentials flow. This flow is legacy, discouraged,
and insecure.

OAuth2 is used in many areas, for various purposes and supported by all well known programming languages, but it is important
to understand what the vision of OAuth2 is. This non-exclusive list might help you decide, if OAuth 2.0 and Hydra are
the right fit for you.

1. If you want to allow third-party developers accessing your APIs now or in the future, Hydra is the perfect fit. This is what an OAuth2 Provider does.
2. If you want to become a Identity Provider, like Google, Facebook or Microsoft, OpenID Connect and thus Hydra is a perfect fit.
3. Running an OAuth2 Provider works great with browser, mobile and wearable apps, as you can avoid storing access
credentials on the device, phone or wearable and revoke access tokens, and thus access privileges, at any time.
4. If you have a lot of services and want to limit automated access (think: cronjobs) for those services,
OAuth2 might make sense for you. Example: The comment service is not allowed to read user passwords when fetching
the latest user profile updates.

# OAuth 2.0 Case Study

OAuth2 and OpenID Connect are tricky to understand. It is important to understand that OAuth2 is
a delegation protocol. It makes sense to use Hydra in new and existing projects. A use case covering an existing project
explains how one would use Hydra in a new one as well. So let's look at a use case!

Let's assume we are running a ToDo List App (todo24.com). ToDo24 has a login endpoint (todo24.com/login).
The login endpoint is written in node and uses MongoDB to store user information (email + password + settings). Of course,
todo24 has other services as well: list management (todo24.com/lists/manage: close, create, move),
item management (todo24.com/lists/items/manage: mark solved, add), and so on. You are using cookie-based sessions to see which
user is performing the request.

Now you decide to use OAuth2 on top of your current infrastructure. There are many reasons to do this:
* You want to open your APIs to third-party developers. Their apps will be using OAuth2 Access Tokens to access a user's to do list.
* You want more client applications, for example browser app (SPA), mobile app, car, ...
* You have Cross Origin Requests. Making cookies work with Cross Origin Requests weakens or even disables important anti-CSRF measures.

These are only a couple of reasons to use OAuth2. You might decide to use OAuth2 as your single source of authorization, thus maintaining
only one authorization protocol and being able to open up to third party devs in no time. With OpenID Connect, you are able to delegate authentication as well as authorization!

Your decision is final. You want to use OAuth2 and you want Hydra to do the job. You install Hydra in your cluster using docker.
Next, you set up some exemplary OAuth2 clients. Clients can act on their own, but most of the time they need to access a user's todo lists.
To do so, the client initiates an OAuth2 request. This is where the [user login & consent flow](hydra/oauth2.md) comes into play.
Before Hydra can issue an access token, we need to know WHICH user is giving consent. To do so, Hydra redirects the user agent (e.g. browser, mobile device)
to the login endpoint alongside with a challenge that contains important request information. The login endpoint (todo24.com/login) authenticates the
user as usual, e.g. by username & password, session cookie or other means. Upon successful authentication, the login endpoint
redirects the user back to ORY Hydra. Next, ORY Hydra needs the user's consent for which the user agent is redirected to the consent endpoint (todo24.com/consent)
where the user is asked for consent: *"Do you want to grant MyCoolAnalyticsApp read & write access to all your todo lists? [Yes] [No]"*. Once the user clicks *Yes* and gives consent,
the consent endpoint redirects back to ORY Hydra which then validates the request and finally issues the access, refresh, and ID tokens.

You can validate the access tokens which are sent to your API directly at ORY Hydra, or use an Identity & Access Proxy
like ORY Oathkeeper to do it for you.
