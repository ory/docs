# Ory Documentation

This repository contains meta-documentation for the
[Ory Ecosystem](https://www.ory.sh/docs/ecosystem/projects/). You can find the
source code for each project here:

- [Ory Kratos](https://github.com/ory/kratos/)
- [Ory Hydra](https://github.com/ory/hydra/)
- [Ory Oathkeeper](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/)
- [Ory Keto](https://github.com/ory/keto/)

Other Ory Projects documentation:

- [Ory Kubernetes Helm Charts](https://github.com/ory/k8s/tree/master/docs/helm)
- [Ory Dockertest](https://github.com/ory/dockertest/blob/v3/README.md)
- [Ory SDKs](https://github.com/ory/sdk/blob/master/README.md)

## Contributing Documentation

## Style and Format

### Categories

Ory Documentations is structured into several main categories. Each of those
categories serves a specific purpose. The purpose of each category is outlined
in short here, to help find the correct category for your documentation to live
in.

- Introduction
  - The purpose of this category is to introduce the very `basics` of the
    project and give newcomers an easy way to start. Contains the most basic
    explanation of the project, an installation guide, a Quickstart/5-Minute
    Tutorial and Contribution Guidelines.
- Concepts
  - The purpose of this category is to give the reader a deep `understanding` of
    the ideas upon which the project is built. Content in this category has the
    form of a discursive explanation. The main goal is to `explain`.
- Guides
  - The purpose of this category is to solve a specific problem. It has the form
    of a `series of steps` towards a goal. It is aimed towards more experienced
    users, who are already familiar with the concepts and tools.
- Reference
  - The purpose of this category is to provide a detailed & in-depth description
    of the project. It has the form of an `austere and to the point explanation`
    and is rooted in code, most often these documents are built directly from
    code without editor interaction. It **does not** give information on how to
    do specific things, but describes how to correctly use the APIs etc.
- SDK
  - Same as the above category but for SDKs, also containing simple guides for
    using SDKs.

### Document Structure

Add a meaningful title and an ID to the top of the document. `id` needs to be
separated with `-` and lowercase, `title` with space and Uppercase. Example:

```
---
id: documentation-id
title: Documentation Title
---
```

## Testing

### Playwright tests

The [Playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright) (E2E) tests file names end with `.spec.ts` and can be found in `/tests/playwright`.
NodeJS is required to run Playright tests locally.
To test the documentation locally:

1. Clone this repository.
1. Enter the `/docs` folder in your local git environment.
1. Install dependencies by running: `npm install`.
1. Run the Docs webserver and test the documentation by running: `npm start`
1. Build the docs and verify by running: `npm run build`

### Jest tests

The Playwright (E2E) tests file names end with `.test.ts`  and can be found in `/tests/jest`.

### Formatting documentation

All documentation (as well as any other files) must be formatted using
[Ory's prettier styles](https://github.com/ory/prettier-styles)

To format all for documentation relevant files simply run the following command
from the repositories main directory:

```sh
cd docs
npm install
npm run format
git commit -a -m "styles: format"
git push
```

## How-To

### Links to other pages

If you would add a link to an outside resource, just go ahead.

**If you want to add a link to a document in our own documentation, add the filename.**

- âœ… `[XY Guide](./guide/XY.md)` 
- ðŸš« `[XY Guide](./guide/XY)`

This prevents [broken links issue](https://github.com/ory/docusaurus-template/issues/38) when you load
the documentation from an outside link.

### Import Markdown

Use the same markdown in several places:

````md
```mdx-code-block
import ExampleMarkdown from './_common/example.md'

<ExampleMarkdown />
```
````

### Code snippets

#### From Github

Use
[CodeFromRemote](https://github.com/ory/docusaurus-template/blob/master/src/theme/CodeFromRemote.js)
to import code directly from Github.

Import at the beginning of your document like so:

```md
---
id: documentation id
title: Documentation Title
---

import CodeFromRemote from '@theme/CodeFromRemote'
```

Then at the place you want the code to appear in the document add:

```js
<CodeFromRemote
  lang="js" # the language of the code you want to add e.g. jsx,tsx,ts,go,yaml,yml,js,html,pug
  link="https://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-node/blob/master/src/middleware/simple.ts"
  src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-node/master/src/middleware/simple.ts"

/>
```

You can use `startAt` and `endAt` if you only want to show a part of the code:

```js
<CodeFromRemote
  lang="yml"
  src="https://github.com/gen1us2k/kratos_flask_example/blob/master/docker-compose.yml"
  startAt="postgres-kratos:"
  endAt="postgres-keto:"
/>
```

#### From this Repository

Use the same code example in several places:

````md
```mdx-code-block
import exampleJs from '!!raw-loader!./code-example.jsx'
import exampleGo from '!!raw-loader!./code-example.go'

<CodeBlock className="language-jsx">{exampleJs}</CodeBlock>
<CodeBlock className="language-go">{exampleGo}</CodeBlock>
```
````

### Videos

When you
[record your screen using Quicktime](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/quicktime-player/qtp97b08e666/mac),
a `.mov` file is recorded. Follow these rules:

1. Please use 16:9 format with at least 1024 pixels wide. `ffmpeg` will scale it to the right size.
1. Please make sure that no history or auto-suggestions are visible.

Once recoded, use the commands below to convert them to `mp4` and `webm`:

```shellsession
file="screencast.mov"

ffmpeg -i $file -an -c:v libvpx-vp9 -vf scale=1024:-1 -crf 30 -b:v 0 "${file%.*}".webm
ffmpeg -i $file -vcodec h264 -vf scale=1024:-1 -an "${file%.*}".mp4
```

Next copy them next to the markdown file you are editing. Then use the following
code to display the video:

```mdx-code-block
import mp4 from './screencast.mp4'
import webm from './screencast.webm'
import VideoEmbed from '@site/src/components/VideoEmbed'

<VideoEmbed mp4={mp4} webm={webm} />
```

### Shell Examples

Use `shellsession`:

````md
```shellsession
npx create-next-app@latest --typescript
npm i --save @ory/integrations
```
````

Please do not prefixes with `$`

```patch
- $ command --arg # do not
+ command --arg # do
```

## CLI Documentation

## Fixing Ory CLI docs

If you find an error in the Ory CLI documentation here are some pointers on how
to fix it:

The code that generates the CLI docs (for Kratos) comes from here:
https://github.com/ory/kratos/blob/master/cmd/clidoc/main.go

`cmd/clidoc/main.go` is the general path for all Ory projects.

The command to generate the CLI docs can be found here:
https://github.com/ory/x/blob/master/clidoc/generate.go#L96
