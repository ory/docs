## How to add links to other pages

If you would add a link to an outside ressource, just go ahead.

**If you want to add a link to a document in our own documentation, please make
sure to add the filename.**

For example `[XY Guide](./guide/XY.md)` rather than `[XY Guide](./guide/XY)`.

This prevents broken links
([issue](https://github.com/ory/docusaurus-template/issues/38)) when you load
the documentation from an outside link.
