Iframes can pose a significant security risk for authentication services due to many attack vectors such as clickjacking, iframe
injection, iframe phishing, and others. Most browsers have implemented measures to block cookies in iframe contexts that break
authentication, CSRF-prevention, and sessions.

- Safari has implemented [Intelligent Tracking Prevention](https://webkit.org/blog/7675/intelligent-tracking-prevention/) which
  blocks third-party cookies by default.
- Firefox has implemented
  [Total Cookie Protection](https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/firefox-rolls-out-total-cookie-protection-by-default-to-all-users-worldwide/)
  which gives third-party cookies a separate cookie jar per site by default, preventing cross-site tracking.
- Google Chrome only blocks third-party cookies in Incognito mode by default, but users can set Google Chrome to block all
  third-party cookies in regular mode. As an alternative, Google has implemented FedCM, which Ory supports. Read more about
  [FedCM](../kratos/social-signin/fedcm.mdx).
- Edge blocks trackers by default. Microsoft is also exploring blocking third-party cookies in Edge by default.
- Brave browser blocks third-party cookies by default.

Identity flows, such as authentication, login, registration, and MFA, must not be embedded inside an iframe! Embedding these flows
increases the risk of phishing, session hijacking, and clickjacking.

Ory has implemented HTTP headers (`X-Frame-Options: DENY` and `Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'none'`) to indicate to
browsers that iframes can't be used with the Ory Account Experience self-service user flows.
