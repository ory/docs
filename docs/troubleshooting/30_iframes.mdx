Iframes can pose a significant security risk for authentication services due to many attack vectors such as clickjacking, iframe
injection, iframe phishing, and many others.

Safari has additionally implemented a feature called
[Intelligent Tracking Prevention](https://webkit.org/blog/7675/intelligent-tracking-prevention/) that blocks third-party cookies
by default in iframe contexts, which breaks authentication, CSRF-prevention, and sessions. Chrome is planning on rolling out the
same changes in 2024.

We therefore discourage use of iframes when using Ory and have implemented HTTP headers (`X-Frame-Options: DENY`) indicating to
browsers that iframes can not be used with the Ory Account Experience.
