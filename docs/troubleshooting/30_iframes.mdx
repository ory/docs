Iframes can pose a significant security risk for authentication services due to many attack vectors such as clickjacking, iframe
injection, iframe phishing, and others. Most browsers have implemented measures to block cookies in iframe contexts that
break authentication, CSRF-prevention, and sessions.

- Safari has implemented [Intelligent Tracking Prevention](https://webkit.org/blog/7675/intelligent-tracking-prevention/) which
  blocks third-party cookies by default.
- Firefox has implemented
  [Total Cookie Protection](https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/firefox-rolls-out-total-cookie-protection-by-default-to-all-users-worldwide/)
  which gives third-party cookies a separate cookie jar per site by default, preventing cross-site tracking.
- Google Chrome only blocks third-party cookies in Incognito mode by default, but users can set Google Chrome to block all third-party
  cookies. As alternative Google implemented FedCM, which Ory supports as well, read more about
  [FedCM](../kratos/social-signin/fedcm.mdx).
- Edge blocks trackers by default. Microsoft is also exploring blocking third-party cookies in Edge by default.
- Brave browser blocks third-party cookies by default.

Identity flows, such as authentication, login, registration, and MFA, must not be embedded inside an iframe! Embedding these
flows increases the risk of phishing, session hijacking, and clickjacking.

Ory has implemented HTTP headers (`X-Frame-Options: DENY` and `Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'none'`) to indicate to
browsers that iframes can't be used with the Ory Account Experience self-service user flows.
