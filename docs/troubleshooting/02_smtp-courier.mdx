If you receive an error pointing you towards this page, your email configuration (SMTP URL) is faulty. The most common
case of a faulty SMTP URL is that the username or password uses special characters which are not URL encoded.

The following URL examples will fail:

```
smtp://username:pass/word@email-smtp.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com:587
smtp://user%name:pass$word@some-email-service.com:587
```

To get these special characters to work, please URL encode the username and password. To URL encode you can use
JavaScript

```js
console.log(encodeURIComponent('pass/word'));
```

or an [online tool](https://www.urlencoder.org). **Please be extremely cautious
when inserting credentials into a random website**.

Let's take a look at the examples from above, properly URL encoded:

```diff
-smtp://username:pass/word@email-smtp.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com:587
+smtp://username:pass%2Fword@email-smtp.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com:587

-smtp://user%name:pass$word@some-email-service.com:587
+smtp://user%25name:pass%24word@some-email-service.com:587
```
