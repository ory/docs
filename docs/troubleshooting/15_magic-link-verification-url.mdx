title: Magic links use old custom domain name
sidebar_label: Wrong domain in magic links
---

After updating their custom domain, some users reported an error that caused the verification emails to come with magic links
generated for the old domain.

This means that after changing the custom domain from `old.production.com` to `new-domain.production.com`, some verification
emails still use `old.production.com` to generate magic links for the verification flow.

This results in emails that contain `https://old.production.com/self-service/verification?code={...}` instead of
`https://new-domain.production.com/self-service/verification?code={...}`.

To fix this error, run this Ory CLI command to force Ory Network to update the `/selfservice/methods/link/config/base_url` configuration
key:

```shell
ory patch identity-config {your-project-id} \
  --remove '/selfservice/methods/link/config/base_url'
```

When you run this command, the `/selfservice/methods/link/config/base_url` updates automatically to use your current custom
domain.

Ory recommends using the "one-time code" verification method. Read
