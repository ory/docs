Sometimes, cookies and CSRF don't work and all requests end up with `401 Unauthorized` or `400 Bad Request`.

In this document you can learn about common causes and fixes when using the Ory Identities API.

### What is Cross Site Request Forgery

Because Ory Identities isn't just an API, but instead talks to your users' browsers directly, several security measures have been
implemented in Ory Identities. One of them is protection against Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

To protect against CSRF, several endpoints are protected by Anti-CSRF measures. Typically, endpoints accepting `POST`, `DELETE`,
`PUT` actions have Anti-CSRF measures. When rendering a form for example, a `<input type="hidden" name="csrf_token" value="...">`
HTML Input Element is added. Ory Identities compares that value to the value set in the Anti-CSRF Cookie. If the values match, the
request is allowed.

Ory Identities uses HTTP cookies to store login sessions when accessed via a browser.

## Common issues

When starting to debug cookie and CSRF issues, make sure to check cookies with
[Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/) or a comparable tool. Look at the **Cookies** section in the
**Application** tab as well as the **Network** tab - look for `Cookie` and `Set-Cookie` HTTP Headers.

### Accessing Ory Identities cookies from client-side JavaScript

The cookies Ory Identities sets can't be accessed directly from client-side JavaScript because the `HttpOnly` flag is set. This
flag can't be modified.

### Accessing Ory Identities APIs from client-side JavaScript / AJAX

When implementing a Single Page App (SPA) using for example Angular or React.js you probably want to access the Ory Identities
Public API. To prevent against several attack vectors, this API is protected with Anti-CSRF measures, even for some `GET`
requests.

To use the Ory Identities API you need to configure your AJAX request to include cookies, because AJAX doesn't send cookies per
default. For example when using the browser's `fetch` function, you need to set
[`credentials: 'include'`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/fetch#Parameters).

### Accessing Ory Identities APIs from a server-side application

When implementing a server-side application for example in PHP, Java, Go, or Node.js, make sure to include the `Cookie` header
from the client when fetching the self-service flows, for example `GET /self-service/login/flows?id=...`:

```ts
export default (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  // ...
  .getLoginFlow({ id: flow, cookie: req.header("cookie") })
}
```

A complete example looks as follows:

```mdx-code-block
import CodeFromRemote from "@site/src/theme/CodeFromRemote"

<CodeFromRemote
  lang="js"
  link="https://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-node/blob/3e4eacea49763f455604fdbd5bea1f90b6f8fee7/src/routes/login.ts#L66"
  src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-node/master/src/routes/login.ts"
/>
```

Without forwarding the `Cookie` HTTP Header it won't be possible to fetch the flow due to a security error. This protection
prevents leaks of personal information when users copy/paste, for example, the login URL.
