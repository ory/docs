# CSRF troubleshooting

When you get `401 Unauthorized` or `400 Bad Request` responses when your application sends requests to Ory Identities APIs, it is
likely that the Ory anti-Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) mechanisms are triggered.

This document describes common scenarios where you can face CSRF problems and gives advice for solving them.

:::tip

To learn more about CSRF and how Ory Identities protects against it, read the
[Ory threat models and security profile documentation](../kratos/concepts/security.mdx) and the
[OWASP attack description](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/csrf).

:::

To debug issues related to cookies or anti-CSRF defenses, use tools like the
[Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/). In Chrome DevTools, go to the **Application** tab and open the
**Cookies** section. Look for `Cookie` and `Set-Cookie` HTTP headers. Inspecting the **Network** tab and looking for the same
headers can also help you find the root cause of your problems.

:::info

Ory Identities uses HTTP cookies to store sessions when accessed via a browser.

## Accessing cookies from client-side JavaScript

The cookies Ory Identities sets can't be accessed directly from client-side JavaScript because the `HttpOnly` flag is set. This
flag can't be modified.

## Accessing APIs from client-side JavaScript / AJAX

When building Single-Page Apps (SPAs) in Angular or React.js and you want the application to access the Ory Identities Public API
you need to configure your AJAX request to include cookies, because AJAX doesn't send cookies by default default.

For example, when using the browser's `fetch` function, you need to set
[`credentials: 'include'`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/fetch#Parameters).

## Accessing APIs from a server-side application

When building a server-side application, make sure to include the `Cookie` header from the client when fetching the self-service
flows, for example, `GET /self-service/login/flows?id=...`:

```ts
export default (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  // ...
  .getLoginFlow({ id: flow, cookie: req.header("cookie") })
}
```

A complete example looks as follows:

```mdx-code-block
import CodeFromRemote from "@site/src/theme/CodeFromRemote"

<CodeFromRemote
  lang="js"
  link="https://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-node/blob/3e4eacea49763f455604fdbd5bea1f90b6f8fee7/src/routes/login.ts#L66"
  src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-node/master/src/routes/login.ts"
/>
```

Without forwarding the `Cookie` HTTP header you can't fetch the flow due to a security error. This prevents leaks of personal
information when users copy and paste, for example, the login URL.
