title: Social sign-in `redirect_uri_mismatch` error (OTA-092022-01)
sidebar_label: redirect_uri_mismatch error
---

This problem affects projects created before September 2022 that use a custom domain. For newly added social sign-in providers,
social sign-in flows can fail with the following message:

```text
Unable to complete OpenID Connect flow because the OpenID Provider returned error "redirect_uri_mismatch": The redirect_uri MUST match the registered callback URL for this application.
```

:::info

If you get this error in projects created after September 2022, read [Social sign-in troubleshooting](./25_social-sign-in.mdx) for
more information.

:::

## Mitigation

To fix the problem, remove the `/selfservice/methods/oidc/config/base_redirect_uri` configuration entry. Run this Ory CLI command:

```shell
## List all available projects
ory list projects

## Remove the configuration entry
ory patch identity-config <project-id> \
  --remove '/selfservice/methods/oidc/config/base_redirect_uri'
```

:::caution

Removing the `base_redirect_uri` can break previously existing and functional social sign-in connections. To fix a broken
connection, choose the provider you want to fix from the <ConsoleLink route="project.socialSignIn" /> section and copy the
redirect URI. Use the value you copied to update the callback URL configuration of the social sign-in provider.
