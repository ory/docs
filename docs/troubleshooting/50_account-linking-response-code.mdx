# Account linking response code change

Starting no sooner than April 13th, 2025, Ory Network will respond with a `400 Bad Request` instead of a `200 OK` when signing up
with Social Sign In for an account that already exists. The associated error message has ID `1010016` and content

> You tried to sign in with %q, but that email is already used by another account. Sign in to your account with one of the options
> below to add your account %[1]q at %q as another way to sign in.

### Previous behavior

A response code of 200 OK was sent when signing up using the OIDC strategy and sending `Accept: application/json` in the request
and an account with the same email address already existed.

### Correct behavior

A response code of 400 OK will be sent when signing up using the OIDC strategy and sending `Accept: application/json` in the
request and an account with the same email address already existed.

### Action Required

- Ensure that your application can handle a `400 Bad Request` response code when signing up with Social Sign In for an account
  that already exists.
- If you depend on data pending removal, contact us via [Zendesk](https://console.ory.sh/support),
  [Slack](https://slack.ory.sh/invitation), or email to support@ory.sh.
