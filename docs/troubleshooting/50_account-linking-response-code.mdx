# Account linking response code change

Starting **no sooner than April 13, 2025**, Ory Network will return a `400 Bad Request` instead of a `200 OK` when a user signs up
with Social Sign-In for an account that already exists. The associated error message has ID `1010016` and states:

> You tried to sign in with %q, but that email is already used by another account. Sign in to your account with one of the options
> below to add your account %[1]q at %q as another way to sign in.

### Previous behavior

When signing up using the OIDC strategy and sending `Accept: application/json` in the request, Ory Network returned a `200 OK`
response even if an account with the same email address already existed.

### New behavior

Ory Network will now return a `400 Bad Request` response in the same scenario.

### Action required

- Ensure that your application can handle a `400 Bad Request` response when signing up with Social Sign-In for an existing
  account.
- If you have questions or concerns, contact us via [Zendesk](https://console.ory.com/support), [Slack](https://slack.ory.com/), or
  email at support@ory.com.
