# Social sign-in troubleshooting

## 'redirect_uri' mismatch

Ensure that the `redirect_uri` query parameter in the URL matches the authorized redirect URI added to the social sign-in
provider.

```
https://{provider}/o/oauth2/v2/auth?client_id=(...)&
redirect_uri=https://$PROJECT_SLUG.projects.oryapis.com/self-service/methods/oidc/callback/{provider}&
response_type=code&scope=email+profile+openid
```

:::info

If you get a `redirect_uri` mismatch error in a project created before September 2022 that uses a custom domain,
[refer to this document](./oidc-redirect-url-cname-OTA-092022-01) for troubleshooting information.

## 'oryapis.com' doesn't work as authorized redirect URI

Integration with social sign-in providers may require proving the ownership of the authorized redirect URI domain. If that is the
case, you must use a custom domain and the `https://$PROJECT_SLUG.projects.oryapis.com` URL can't be used as the redirect URI.

To add your domain to the `redirect_uri` query parameter when redirecting to the social sign-in provider, adjust your project's
`base_redirect_uri` configuration. To do that, use the Ory CLI:

```shell
ory patch identity-config {project-id} --add '/selfservice/methods/oidc/config/base_redirect_uri="https://ory.your-custom-domain.com"'
```

:::tip

Ensure that the custom domain is added to the social sign-in provider as an authorized redirect URI.

## Redirect loops after successful registration

Ory redirects users back to the registration page after a successful OIDC flow when some identity traits, for example a phone
number, couldn't be mapped using the data received from the social sign-in provider and require manual input from the user.

However, when the Jsonnet configuration for the social sign-in provider is incorrect and Ory can't map the data correctly, the
user sees no input fields and the registration page gets stuck in a redirect loop.

To understand how to fix the problem, let's look at how Ory handles the OIDC registration flow. There are 5 steps that the system
performs when users register with a social sign-in provider:

1. Redirect to the social sign-in provider.
2. Redirect back to Ory with a `code` query parameter.
3. Ory exchanges the `code` for an access token and retrieves the user information.
4. Ory maps the user information to the [Identity Schema traits](../kratos/manage-identities/identity-schema).
5. (optional) Ory redirects back to the registration page, requiring the user to provide the values for the missing traits.

When step 4 fails, Ory becomes stuck in a redirect loop. To fix the redirect loop, adjust the Jsonnet configuration for the social
sign-in provider so that the data from the provider gets mapped correctly to the Identity Schema.
