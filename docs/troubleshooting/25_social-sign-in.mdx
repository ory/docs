# Social sign-in troubleshooting

## Redirect loops after registration

Ory redirects users back to the registration page after a successful OIDC flow when some identity traits, for example a phone
number, couldn't be mapped using the data received from the social sign-in provider and require manual input from the user.

However, when the Jsonnet configuration for the social sign-in provider is incorrect and Ory can't map the data correctly, the
user sees no input fields and the registration page gets stuck in a redirect loop.

To understand how to fix the problem, let's look at how Ory handles the OIDC registration flow. There are 5 steps that the system
performs when users register with a social sign-in provider:

1. Redirect to the social sign-in provider.
2. Redirect back to Ory with a `code` query parameter.
3. Ory exchanges the `code` for an access token and retrieves the user information.
4. Ory maps the user information to the [Identity Schema traits](../kratos/manage-identities/identity-schema).
5. (optional) Ory redirects back to the registration page, requiring the user to provide the values for the missing traits.

When step 4 fails, Ory becomes stuck in a redirect loop. To fix the redirect loop, adjust the Jsonnet configuration for the social
sign-in provider so that the data from the provider gets mapped correctly to the Identity Schema. Read
[Map and merge profile data](../kratos/social-signin/data-mapping) to learn more.

### Debug Jsonnet claims mapping

When the registration flow gets stuck in a redirect loop, it's often because the Jsonnet snippet fails to map the incoming claims
from the social sign-in provider to your Identity Schema traits. To debug this, it can help to see the actual claims data Ory
receives from the provider and how it's structured.

1. To ensure the registration process can complete simplify the `identity.traits` section in your Jsonnet, perhaps only mapping
   one non-essential field or even leaving it empty `{}`.
2. To capture the full claims object add a field to `identity.metadata_public`. Or `identity.metadata_admin` if the claims contain
   sensitive data you don't want exposed to the user.

Here's an example of a minimal Jsonnet configuration for debugging purposes:

```jsonnet
local claims = std.extVar('claims');
{
  identity: {
    traits: {
      // Minimal traits mapping - adjust as needed
      [if 'email' in claims && claims.email_verified then 'email' else null]: claims.email,
      // You might even use traits: {} temporarily if no traits are strictly required
    },
    metadata_public: {
      // Store all received claims
      debug_claims: claims
    }
  },
}
```

1. Apply temporary Jsonnet configuration to your social sign-in provider settings.
2. Attempt the registration flow again with the social provider. The registration should now succeed.
3. Inspect the identity created in Ory. You can use the Ory Console, Ory CLI, or the API.
4. Analyze the `debug_claims`. This shows what data your Jsonnet has access to via the claims variable.
5. Fix your original Jsonnet traits mapping logic so it references only available claims.
6. Once your primary Jsonnet mapping is fixed, remove the temporary `debug_claims` field from the metadata.

## 'oryapis.com' doesn't work as authorized redirect URI

Integration with social sign-in providers may require proving the ownership of the authorized redirect URI domain. If that is the
case, you must use a custom domain and the `https://$PROJECT_SLUG.projects.oryapis.com` URL can't be used as the redirect URI.

To add your domain to the `redirect_uri` query parameter when redirecting to the social sign-in provider, adjust your project's
`base_redirect_uri` configuration. To do that, use the Ory CLI:

```shell
ory patch identity-config --project <project-id> --workspace <workspace-id> --add '/selfservice/methods/oidc/config/base_redirect_uri="https://ory.your-custom-domain.com"'
```

:::tip

Ensure that the custom domain is added to the social sign-in provider as an authorized redirect URI.

:::

## 'redirect_uri' mismatch

Ensure that the `redirect_uri` query parameter in the URL matches the authorized redirect URI added to the social sign-in
provider.

```
https://{provider}/o/oauth2/v2/auth?client_id=(...)&
redirect_uri=https://$PROJECT_SLUG.projects.oryapis.com/self-service/methods/oidc/callback/{provider}&
response_type=code&scope=email+profile+openid
```

### Social sign-in `redirect_uri_mismatch` error (OTA-092022-01)

This affects only projects created before September 2022 that use a custom domain. For newly added social sign-in providers,
social sign-in flows can fail with the following message:

```text
Unable to complete OpenID Connect flow because the OpenID Provider returned error "redirect_uri_mismatch": The redirect_uri MUST match the registered callback URL for this application.
```

#### Mitigation OTA-092022-01

To fix the problem, remove the `/selfservice/methods/oidc/config/base_redirect_uri` configuration entry. Run this Ory CLI command:

```shell
## List all available workspaces
ory list workspaces

## List all available projects
ory list projects --workspace <workspace-id>

## Remove the configuration entry
ory patch identity-config <project-id> \
  --remove '/selfservice/methods/oidc/config/base_redirect_uri'
```

Removing the `base_redirect_uri` can break previously existing and functional social sign-in connections. To fix a broken
connection, choose the provider you want to fix from the <ConsoleLink route="project.socialSignIn" /> section and copy the
redirect URI. Use the value you copied to update the callback URL configuration of the social sign-in provider.
