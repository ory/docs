## Relying party ID mismatch

> The relying party ID is not a registrable domain suffix of, nor equal to the current domain. Subsequently, an attempt to fetch

### Solve relying party ID mismatch

The error message indicates that the relying party ID (RP ID) is not a registrable domain suffix of, nor equal to the current
domain. This error occurs when the RP ID is not a valid domain or subdomain.

To resolve this issue, ensure that the RP ID is a valid domain or subdomain. If you are using a subdomain, ensure that the RP ID
is a registrable domain suffix of the current domain.

TODO: Add more information on how to fix this issue.
