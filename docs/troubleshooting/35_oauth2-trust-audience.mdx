If you're experiencing issues on Ory Network related to the required audience for the
[OAuth2 JWT profile](../hydra/guides/jwt.mdx) while using a custom domain, follow these troubleshooting steps:

- When using the [OAuth2 JWT profile](../hydra/guides/jwt.mdx), the default required audience will be the
  `https://$PROJECT_SLUG.projects.oryapis.com` domain associated with your Ory Network project.
- To use your custom domain as the audience instead, update the OAuth2 Issuer URL of your project to match your custom domain.
  Refer to [Change the OAuth2 issuer URL](../oauth2-oidc/issuer-url.mdx) for instructions on how to change the OAuth2 Issuer URL.
