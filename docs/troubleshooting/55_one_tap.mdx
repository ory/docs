title: Google One Tap fails
---

If you receive an error such as

```json
"error": {
  "message": "Upstream error",
  "reason": "No nonce was provided but is required by the provider",
  "status": "Bad Gateway",
  "status_code": 502
}
```

when performing social sign in using Google One Tap, you must
[set the nonce parameter](https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web/reference/js-reference#nonce) when calling the Google
SDK.
