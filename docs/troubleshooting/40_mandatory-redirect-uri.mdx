# Mandatory `redirect_uri` for OpenID Connect Flows

Starting no sooner than August 1st, 2024, Ory Network will enforce the inclusion of `redirect_uri` in OpenID Connect flow
requests. This update aligns with OpenID Connect specifications.

### Previous Behavior

You could omit the `redirect_uri` parameter:

```
/oauth2/auth?scope=openid&client=1234
```

### New Requirement

You must include the `redirect_uri` parameter:

```
/oauth2/auth?scope=openid&client=1234&redirect_uri=https://...
```

### Action Required

- Update your OpenID Connect flow requests to include `redirect_uri`.
- If you depend on data pending removal, contact us via [Zendesk](https://console.ory.sh/support),
  [Slack](https://slack.ory.sh/invitation), or email to support@ory.sh.

For any questions or further assistance, please reach out to our support channels.
