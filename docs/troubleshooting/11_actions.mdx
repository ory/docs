This document describes common issues with Ory Actions and how to solve them.

## Webhook is not triggered

If an Ory Action webhook fails to trigger, verify whether the **sign in after registration** `session` hook is activated. Because
the `session` hook modifies the HTTP response, no other hooks are executed after it. If you want to execute other hooks besides
the `session` hook, you need to make sure that it is executed last.

To debug this issue, [export the Ory Identities configuration](../guides/cli/15_config-identity-service.mdx) and check the order
of the actions. The `session` hook should be the last one to run.

For more information on the `session` hook, see [Sign in after registration](../actions/session.mdx) documentation.
