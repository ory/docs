The Ory Console uses role-based access control enforced through Ory Keto. Roles are assigned at two levels: workspace and project.

## Workspace roles

A workspace has two roles: Owner and Developer.

### Owner

The Owner role has full administrative control over the workspace.

- View and edit workspace metadata
- Upgrade the workspace plan
- View and manage billing
- View and manage members
- Create and delete workspace API keys
- Create projects and view the projects list

### Developer

The Developer role provides day-to-day access without administrative capabilities.

- View workspace metadata
- Create projects and view the projects list
- View members
- View workspace API keys

Developers cannot:

- Edit workspace metadata
- Manage billing
- Manage workspace members
- Create or delete workspace API keys

## Project roles

A project has two roles: Owner and Developer.

The Owner role has full control over the project, including destructive and administrative actions. Owners inherit all Developer
permissions.

In addition to Developer permissions, Owners can:

- Delete the project
- Move the project between workspaces
- Upgrade the project plan
- Add and remove collaborators
- Modify project workspace settings

### Developer

The Developer role provides full access to project configuration and all Ory services.

- Read and write project configuration
- View collaborators
- Manage project API keys
- Manage custom domains (CNAMEs)
- Manage event streams
- Full access to Ory Identities (read/write identities, credentials, sessions, and messages)
- Full access to Ory Permissions (read/write relationships, read permissions)
- Full access to Ory OAuth2 (read/write clients)

Developers cannot:

- Delete or move the project
- Add or remove collaborators
- Modify project workspace settings
