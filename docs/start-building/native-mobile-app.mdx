Ory Cloud supports native applications, for example browser apps, single page apps (SPAs), and mobile apps.

## React Native

The [React Native example](http://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-react-native) and its
[accompanying guide](https://www.ory.sh/login-react-native-authentication-example-api/) are using Ory Cloud's playground project
to showcase how adding Ory to native apps works. You can download and try out this app from the
[Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ory-profile-app/id1536546333) and
[Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ory.kratos_self_service_ui_react_native&hl=en&gl=US).

If you have an Ory Cloud Project, try entering your Ory Cloud Project's slug in the "Project" text field.

<p>
  <img
    alt="Enter the Project Slug in the Ory Profile App"
    src={useBaseUrl('/img/docs/project-selection.jpeg')}
    width="60%"
    align="center"
    style={{ margin: '0 auto', display: 'block' }}
  />
</p>

To get your project's slug, sign in at [console.ory.sh](https://console.ory.sh/), select **Connect** from the left navigation
panel, and copy the URL from the **SDK Configuration** section. The slug is the part between `https://` and
`projects.oryapis.com`.

For example, given the following SDK URL

```
https://jolly-proskuriakova-xf13qw5t8g.projects.oryapis.com
```

the slug would be

```
jolly-proskuriakova-xf13qw5t8g
```

Feel free to use our React Native repository as the starting point for your application! It's licensed as Apache 2.0, which means
