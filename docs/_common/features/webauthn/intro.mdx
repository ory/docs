The Web Authentication Browser API (also known as WebAuthn) is a [specification](https://w3c.github.io/webauthn/) written by the
[W3C](https://www.w3.org/) and [FIDO](https://fidoalliance.org/). The WebAuthn API allows servers to register and authenticate
users using public key cryptography instead of a password. WebAuthn is commonly used with

- a USB, NFC, or Bluetooth low energy device (e.g. [YubiKey](https://www.yubico.com)) to authenticate;
- using an Operating System "platform module" (e.g. TouchID, FaceID, Windows Hello Face, Android Biometric Authentication, ...);

Once the end-user triggers the WebAuthn process, the browser will show a WebAuthn prompt which looks different per browser:

Ory's WebAuthN implementation can be used for both multi-factor authentication and passwordless authentication. You need to
configure whether WebAuthn is used for passwordless, or for multi-factor authentication.
