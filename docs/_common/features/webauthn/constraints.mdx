There are some limitations to WebAuthN to be considered in development:

- WebAuthN is a Browser standard. It does not work on native mobile apps.
- WebAuthN is limited to one domain and does not work in a local environment
  when using CNAME / Ory Proxy. WebAuthN uses an `https://origin` URL as part of
  the client<->server challenge/response mechanism. This mechanism allows for
  only one URL as the origin. Read more in the
  [WebAuthN guide](https://webauthn.guide/) and on
  [GitHub](https://github.com/w3c/webauthn/issues/1372).
- Implementing WebAuthN in your own UI can be challenging, depending on which
  framework to use. Please check our
  [reference implementations](./custom-ui.mdx) to see how we solved it for
  different app types (web, single page app).
