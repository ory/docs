Ory is fundamentally rooted in open source, its community dynamics, and development principles. Ory's software is licensed under
the Apache 2.0 license. Ory's founders have decades of experience in open source and open knowledge.

To build open source software and help its community and adoption grow, Ory offers a commercial product which uses open source
software from Ory and others like the Linux foundation.

## Why Ory is developing Open Source

Building a profitable open source business is non-trivial. But there are many good reasons why
[open source is the right choice](https://opensource.google/documentation/reference/why) for companies like Ory:

- Engineering Economics: Releasing work as open source and the corresponding contribution process eventually result in a higher
  return on the initial investment made versus the alternative closed source process.
- Establishing or Supporting an Open Standard: Publishing your project under an open source license can encourage adoption of a
  standard. When a project becomes a standard, you benefit from a massive influx of outside contributors so the project, and the
  ecosystem around it, evolves more rapidly.
- Disintermediation: Releasing open source software can serve to decouple software components and create an opening to compete in a new field.
  Consider Kubernetes, software for automating management, deployment, operations and scaling of containerized applications.
- Driving Adoption of a Platform and Ecosystem: Releasing a project as open source allows others to adapt and build on top of your
  project. When people build on top of your project, they are invested in your success as well as their own. In cohesive
  communities there are frequently skilled participants who move across company boundaries with a primary affiliation to the
  project.
- Paradigm Shift: Technologies and architectures sometimes grow stagnant, and open source projects with fresh thinking can drive
  sea change. For instance, the release of MongoDB, Couchbase, and other "NoSQL" databases shook up the one size fits all approach
  taken with relational databases.
- Recruiting and Onboarding: Recruiting is rarely, if ever, a primary goal of releasing a project under an open source license.
  But it is almost always a useful side effect, especially when a company open sources things that are widely used internally.

## Binary and Docker releases

Ory releases binaries and docker images for its open source projects. Releases are published on a quarterly basis (spring, summer,
autumn, winter) unless:

- There are no changes that would warrant a release, skipping the quarterly release until there are such changes.
- Bugfixes or security fixes are required, in which case a release is published as soon as possible.
