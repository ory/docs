title: Protect a Page or Screen with Login

In this guide, you will add a page or screen to your application that can only
be accessed when a user is signed in. You will be using Ory's Identity Service
and SDKs to achieve this.

Before you start make sure to either

1. have a running [Ory Cloud Project](./console/create-project.mdx);
2. or are running
   [Ory's Identity service (Ory Kratos) on your machine](../self-hosted/identity/run.mdx).

## Pick Your Technology

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
```
