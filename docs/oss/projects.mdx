We provide an open source ecosystem of services with clear boundaries that solve authentication and authorization:

- Ory Kratos is an identity management server.
- Ory Hydra is an OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect provider.
- Ory Oathkeeper is an Identity and Access Proxy.
- Ory Keto is an access control server.

Each service works standalone but you can also combine them to get the full feature set. If you've never heard of an Identity &
Access Proxy before, or you want to learn more about the individual services and how they play together, stick with us through the
next paragraphs.

Almost every application has the concept of users and permissions. An anonymous user, for example, is allowed to read blog posts
while certain authenticated users are allowed to write blog posts. While this is the basis for most applications out there, access
control becomes increasingly complex as an application grows. What started out with a user's username and password now shifted to
machine-2-machine interaction, third party developers accessing your user's data, and maybe even a micro service system
architecture.

Our projects solve the simplest use case and give you the ability to instantly ready the system for more complex scenarios without
painful and slow upgrade processes.

## Ory Kratos

![Ory Kratos](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ory/meta/master/static/logos/logo-kratos.svg)

The identity management server Ory Kratos enables you to implement user management, login and registration in a secure and
straightforward way. Don't rewrite every aspect of identity management yourself. Ory Kratos implements all common flows such as
login and logout, account activation, mfa/2fa, profile and session management, user facing errors and account recovery methods.
Just spin up a docker image and write a simple UI for it in the language or framework of your choice. Don't worry about GDPR,
address verification or protecting your users data against common and frequently changing attack vectors. Ory Kratos applies
security standards established by experts (National Institute of Sciences NIST, Internet Engineering Task Force IETF, Microsoft
Research, Google Research, Troy Hunt, ..), so you can concentrate on building. You have custom requirements for your users
experience? No problem, implement your own custom flows without hassle.

## Ory Hydra

Ory Hydra enables you to become an OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect provider. If you're not writing a basic web app but something that
has to work on different devices, that has machine-2-machine interaction, or enables third-party developers to use your API (and
pay for it), then this is what you're looking for. Ory Hydra isn't identity management, though. Instead, it connects to your
existing identity management (for example the one from the paragraph above, or your MySQL+PHP login service, or your Federated
SAML SSO) and is capable of issuing, in a secure and OpenID Certified manner, access, refresh, and ID tokens. Of course, it's
shipped as a 5MB Docker Image with almost no configuration required.

## Ory Oathkeeper

Now that your users access your application through, for example, a React/Angular app and a REST api, you need a way to
authenticate the user and to check if they have the necessary permissions (we call this "access control" from now on). One way
would be, of course, to add these checks in your code. Another is to deploy the 5MB Ory Oathkeeper Docker Image, define access
rules for your API endpoints (for example OAuth 2.0 Access Token + certain set of permissions, a valid JSON Web Token, a valid
SAML assertion, ...) and put it - like a firewall - in front of your services.

## Ory Keto

You might start out with a simple permission system. You've got different roles: anonymous users (not logged in), authenticated
users (logged in), and administrators. At some point however, the system gets more complex. You want to distinguish permissions
based on the user's organization, the access time (think time lock in banking), or the billing plan he/she's on. Big cloud
providers such as Amazon Web Services or Google solve this using "Access Control Policies". These policies represent flexible
rules and allow you to express complex access control scenarios. You could, of course, write your own system or spend a bit of
time educating yourself about RBAC, ACL, ABAC, ACP - or (you probably already guessed it) - boot up the 5MB Ory Keto Docker Image.
Ory Keto is able to authenticate different types of credentials (for example OAuth 2.0 Access Tokens, SAML Assertions, JSON Web
Tokens, ...) and allows you to define advanced permission rules ("Access Control Policies"). And there's of course an endpoint
that tells you if a certain set of credentials (for example an OAuth 2.0 Access Token) is allowed to modify that blog post.

## Ory Polis

![Ory Polis](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ory/meta/master/static/logos/logo-polis.svg)

Ory Polis is your trusted solution for enterprise Single Sign-On (SSO) without the headaches of SAML and OIDC. If you're building
a multi-tenant SaaS platform and your B2B customers need to sign in with their corporate identity providers—like Entra ID, Okta or
Google Workspace - Ory Polis makes it simple. Instead of creating custom SSO flows for each customer and wrestling with complex
SAML configurations, you can deploy the Ory Polis Docker image and be ready in minutes. Ory Polis abstracts away the protocol
complexity by translating SAML into a standard OAuth 2.0 or OIDC flow, creating a seamless bridge between your application and
enterprise identity providers. It’s modular, supports your preferred database, and can be self-hosted for complete control over
data and privacy. Built for flexibility and scale, Ory Polis handles as many tenants and identity providers as your business
demands. If you're delivering enterprise-grade SaaS and need SSO that just works, Ory Polis is the missing link.

## Ory Elements

![Ory Elements](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ory/meta/master/static/logos/logo-elements.svg)

Ory Elements is a component library that allows you to build custom user interfaces for Ory self-service flows. It provides a set
of pre-built components that can be easily integrated into your application, enabling you to create a seamless user experience
while leveraging Ory's powerful authentication and identity management capabilities. Ory Elements is designed to work with Ory
Kratos' self-service flows, such as login, registration, settings, verification, and recovery, as well as the OAuth2 consent flow.
It allows you to customize the look and feel of your UI to match your brand and user experience requirements. You can use Ory
Elements to build a custom UI that fits your application's design and user experience.
