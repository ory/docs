This document provides an overview of the most popular Ory open-source projects, and other related resources.

Ory has an open-source architecture, attitude, and heart. We believe in collaboration, participation, and the open exchange of
ideas. Open source is a fundamental part of modern software development and allows everyone regardless of economic background to
build a better world with software.

Most of what Ory does is open source. Read more about [Ory's commitment to open source](./open-source/commitment.mdx).

## Is open source taking a back seat?

No — open source remains at the core of Ory.

The Ory Network and the Ory Enterprise License are commercial offerings designed to fund and accelerate the development of Ory
Open Source. They enable long-term sustainability, support enterprise requirements, and provide capabilities that are difficult to
deliver through open source alone — such as multi-tenancy, analytics, SLAs, SRE support, high scalability, high availability,
globally distributed low-latency infrastructure, and more.

Both Ory Network and the Ory Enterprise License are built on top of the [Ory Open Source](https://github.com/ory/) code base. They
use the same APIs, features, and configurations, with enhancements tailored for multi-tenant architectures and enterprise-grade
security and operations.

Ory is committed to continuing the growth of its open-source ecosystem — making it even more accessible, customizable, and
developer-friendly. The commercial offerings play a key role in accelerating and sustaining the development of Ory Open Source.
