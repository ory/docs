[Mailchimp](https://www.mailchimp.com) is an email marketing platform that provides tools and services to help businesses send
marketing emails, newsletters, and automated campaigns to their customers. It allows you to create, manage, and send emails to
your subscribers, as well as segment and target specific groups of subscribers based on their interests and behaviors.

To integrate Mailchimp using Ory Actions, you must complete these steps:

1. Create a Mailchimp account.
2. Create a new list in Mailchimp.
3. Create a [Mailchimp API key](https://mailchimp.com/en-gb/help/about-api-keys/).
4. Configure the Ory Action to synchronize user data with Mailchimp.
5. Test the integration by signing up with a test account in your Ory Network project and checking that the corresponding user
   data is updated in Mailchimp.

## Configuration

:::info

Unsure what JsonNet is? Read the [Ory Actions webhook guide](../../guides/integrate-with-ory-cloud-through-webhooks.mdx).

:::

1. First, create a Jsonnet file. It transforms the identity data from Ory to a format Mailchimp understands:

   :::info

   For Mailchimp, you must pass the API key in the request body. This means you must include it in the Jsonnet snippet.

   :::

   ```jsonnet title="./mailchimp_identify.jsonnet"
   function(ctx) {
   key: "{Your-Mailchimp-Api-Key}",
   message: {
      from_email: "hello@example.com",
      subject: "Hello from Ory",
      text: "Welcome to Ory! Have fun and happy hacking!",
      to: [
         {
         email: ctx.identity.verifiable_addresses[0].value,
         type: "to"
         }
      ]
   }
   }
   ```

2. To use this Jsonnet snippet, encode it to Base64 and save it to the clipboard:

   ```shell
   cat mailchimp_identify.jsonnet | base64 | pbcopy
   ```

3. Next, define the Ory Action as a JSON Object. Remember to replace the placeholders with your data.

   ```json title="./webhook-action.json"
   {
     "hook": "web_hook",
     "config": {
       "url": "https://mandrillapp.com/api/1.0/messages/send",
       "method": "POST",
       "body": "base64://{ENCODED_JSONNET}"
     }
   }
   ```

4. Finally, add this action to your Ory Network Project using the Ory CLI.

- You can trigger this webhook after successful registration:

  ```shell
  ory patch identity-config {project-id} \
    --add "/selfservice/flows/registration/after/hooks/0=$(cat webhook-action.json)" \
    --format yaml
  ```

- Alternatively, you can trigger this action only when the user signs up with a password or social sign-in:

  ```shell
  ory patch identity-config {project-id} \
    --add "/selfservice/flows/registration/after/password/hooks/0=$(cat webhook-action.json)" \
    --format yaml
  ```
