[HubSpot](https://www.hubspot.com) is an inbound marketing, sales, and customer service platform. It provides a suite of tools and
services that allow businesses to manage and optimize their online presence, including website content, email marketing, social
media, lead generation, and analytics. HubSpot's platform is designed to be a one-stop-shop for businesses to manage their
marketing and sales efforts, and the platform integrates with a variety of third-party tools and services to provide a
comprehensive and seamless experience for users. Ory can synchronize user data with HubSpot via the
[HubSpot contact list API](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/api/crm/contacts).

To integrate HubSpot using Ory Actions, you must complete these steps:

1. Create a HubSpot account and set up the necessary contact lists for your customer data.
2. Create a [private app access token](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/api/private-apps) in HubSpot.
3. In your Ory Network project, set up an Ory Action trigger that will send data to the HubSpot destination when a specific event
   occurs, for example on successful registration.
4. Test the integration to ensure that data is routed correctly from your application to HubSpot.

## Configuration

:::info

Not sure what Jsonnet is? Read the [Ory Actions webhook guide](../../guides/integrate-with-ory-cloud-through-webhooks.mdx).

:::

1. First, create a Jsonnet file. It transforms the identity data from Ory to a format Hubspot understands:

```jsonnet title="./hubspot_identify.jsonnet"
function(ctx) {
  properties: {
    email: ctx.identity.traits.email,
    firstname: ctx.identity.traits.name,
    // ...
  },
}
```

2. To use this Jsonnet snippet, encode it to Base64 and save it to the clipboard:

```shell
cat hubspot_identify.jsonnet | base64 | pbcopy
```

3. Next, define the Ory Action as a JSON Object. Remember to replace the placeholders with your data.

```json title="./webhook-action.json"
{
  "hook": "web_hook",
  "config": {
    "response": {
      "ignore": true
    },
    "auth": {
      "type": "api_key",
      "config": {
        "name": "Authorization",
        "value": "Bearer {YOUR_API_KEY_HERE}",
        "in": "header"
      }
    },
    "url": "https://api.hubapi.com/crm/v3/objects/contacts",
    "method": "POST",
    "body": "base64://{ENCODED_JSONNET}"
  }
}
```

4. Finally, add this action to your Ory Network Project using the Ory CLI.

- You can trigger this webhook after successful registration:

  ```shell
  ory patch identity-config {project-id} \
    --add "/selfservice/flows/registration/after/hooks/0=$(cat webhook-action.json)" \
    --format yaml
  ```

- Alternatively, you can trigger this action only when the user signs up with a password or social sign-in:

  ```shell
  ory patch identity-config {project-id} \
    --add "/selfservice/flows/registration/after/password/hooks/0=$(cat webhook-action.json)" \
    --format yaml
  ```
