# Live event streams

You can stream events (sign-ups, logins, machine-to-machine tokens issued, and many more) in real-time, live as they happen in
your Ory Network project, to your own infrastructure. Pipe those events into your own data warehouse, data lake, or flavor of
choice, and use them to power your own analytics, dashboards, data science, and more.

Live event streams are available for Ory Network enterprise contracts. Talk to your account manager or
[reach out directly](https://www.ory.sh/contact/).

## Event shape

Ory emits events for many different actions. All events abide by the same schema:

```json
{
  "name": string,       // The unique name of the event (e.g., "IdentityCreated").
  "version": string,     // The numerical schema version of the event as a string.
  "timestamp": string,  // ISO 8601 formatted timestamp when the event occurred.
  "projectId": string,  // The ID of the Ory project the event belongs to.
  "eventAttributes": map<string, string> // Additional event-specific attributes.
}
```

Example:

```json
{
  "name": "WebhookSucceeded",
  "version": "1",
  "timestamp": "2025-05-16 11:18:56",
  "eventAttributes": {
    "GeoLocationCity": "Munich",
    "WebhookID": "",
    "WebhookTriggerID": "18093e08-0f72-445f-aacb-151fc777a232"
  }
}
```

Important:

- Per the JSON specification, ordering of keys in objects is not guaranteed and should not be relied upon.
- New keys can appear at any time, consumers should be designed to handle this.
- The exact content in the `eventAttributes` field is not documented and not considered stable. That means that no backwards
  compatibility guarantees are made for them.

If you intend to write a consumer that needs a detailed schema and stability guarantees about the `eventAttributes` field, please
[open a support ticket](https://console.ory.sh/support/).

## Event names

The following is a list of all events that are currently supported. The first column corresponds to the `name` field in an event.
New event names may be added in the future, in which case this list will be updated accordingly.

### Ory Identities

| **Event**                    | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **IdentityCreated**          | A new identity (user or account) has been created.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **IdentityDeleted**          | An identity has been deleted from the system.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **IdentityUpdated**          | An existing identity's details have been modified or updated. The `IdentityActive attribute` in the event indicates the state of the active flag, as many SCIM providers deactivate users by setting `active=false`. |

## Delivery guarantees

1. Possible duplicates: There might be duplicates in the event stream. While rare (typically caused by retries because of network
   issues), consumers should be prepared to deal with them, for example by implementing deduplication logic.
1. Best-effort delivery: Event delivery is best-effort. While most events are delivered reliably, events may be lost under adverse
   conditions (for example, system crashes during request processing). Delivery is not guaranteed to be "at-least-once".
1. No delivery latency SLA: Ory does not offer a Service Level Agreement (SLA) for event delivery duration (the time between an
   event occurring and it appearing in your consumer or the Ory Console UI). However, typical delivery times are observed to be
   less than 5 seconds.
1. No ordering guarantees: Events may arrive in any order, both within a request and across different requests.

Stronger guarantees can be implemented for your use case if needed, in this case please
[open a support ticket](https://console.ory.sh/support/).

## Configure event streams

Is your workload not running on AWS or you don't want to use SNS? [Reach out](https://www.ory.sh/contact/) to discuss your
requirements! Event streams can be implemented for any data warehouse, data lake, or equivalent solution.

### Stream to AWS SNS

Configuring AWS SNS as an event stream destination is easy and requires no exchange of confidential information.

1. Create an AWS SNS topic, and record its ARN (Amazon Resource Name), for example:

```
arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:my-topic
```

2. Create an AWS IAM role with publish permission to that topic. Sample IAM policy:

```json title="IAM role policy (replace <YOUR TOPIC ARN> with your topic ARN created above)"
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "OryNetworkEventStreamPublish",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": ["sns:Publish"],
      "Resource": ["<YOUR TOPIC ARN>"]
    }
  ]
}
```

Record the ARN of the IAM role you created, for example:

```
arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/ory-network-event-streamer
```

3. Attach the following trust policy to the IAM role you created in step 2, replacing `<YOUR PROJECT UUID>` with your project ID:

```json title="Trust policy (replace <YOUR PROJECT UUID>)"
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "601538168777"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "sts:ExternalId": "<YOUR PROJECT UUID>"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

This allows Ory Network to assume the role in your AWS account, and publish to your SNS topic.

4. Use the Ory CLI to configure the event stream, replacing the ARNs with those recorded in steps 1 and 2:

```shell
ory create event-stream
  --project "$YOUR_PROJECT_ID" \
  --type sns \
  --aws-sns-topic-arn "$YOUR_TOPIC_ARN" \
  --aws-iam-role-arn "$YOUR_IAM_ROLE_ARN"
```

5. You are now ready to receive events in your AWS SNS topic!

:::tip

For development purposes, you can subscribe an email address to your topic, and receive events via email. For production use,
subscribe AWS SQS, AWS Kinesis Data Firehose, or any other AWS service that can consume events from an SNS topic. Check the
[AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-event-destinations.html) for ideas.

:::

## Retry policy

If your event stream destination is unavailable or misconfigured, Ory Network will retry sending the event multiple times with an
exponential backoff between attempts.
