# Live event streams

You can stream events (sign-ups, logins, machine-to-machine tokens issued, and many more) in real-time, live as they happen in
your Ory Network project, to your own infrastructure. Pipe those events into your own data warehouse, data lake, or flavor of
choice, and use them to power your own analytics, dashboards, data science, and more.

Live event streams are available for Ory Network enterprise contracts. Talk to your account manager or reach out
[directly](https://www.ory.sh/contact/) to find out more.

## Stream to AWS SNS

Configuring AWS SNS as an event stream destination is easy and requires no exchange of confidential information.

1. Create an AWS SNS topic, and record its ARN (Amazon Resource Name), for example:

```
arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:my-topic
```

2. Create an AWS IAM role with publish permission to that topic. Sample IAM policy:

```json title="IAM role policy (replace <YOUR TOPIC ARN> with your topic ARN created above)"
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "OryNetworkEventStreamPublish",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": ["sns:Publish"],
      "Resource": ["<YOUR TOPIC ARN>"]
    }
  ]
}
```

Record the ARN of the IAM role you created, for example:

```
arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/ory-network-event-streamer
```

3. Attach the following trust policy to the IAM role you created in step 2, replacing `<YOUR PROJECT UUID>` with your project ID:

```json title="Trust policy (replace <YOUR PROJECT UUID>)"
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "601538168777"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "sts:ExternalId": "<YOUR PROJECT UUID>"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

This allows Ory Network to assume the role in your AWS account, and publish to your SNS topic.

4. Use the Ory CLI to configure the event stream, replacing the ARNs with those recorded in steps 1 and 2:

```shell
ory create event-stream
  --project "$YOUR_PROJECT_ID" \
  --type sns \
  --aws-sns-topic-arn "$YOUR_TOPIC_ARN" \
  --aws-iam-role-arn "$YOUR_IAM_ROLE_ARN"
```

5. You are now ready to receive events in your AWS SNS topic!

:::tip

For development purposes, you can subscribe an email address to your topic, and receive events via email. For production use,
subscribe AWS SQS, AWS Kinesis Data Firehose, or any other AWS service that can consume events from an SNS topic. Check the
[AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-event-destinations.html) for ideas.

:::

## Retry policy

If your event stream destination is unavailable or misconfigured, Ory Network will retry sending the event multiple times with an
exponential backoff between attempts.
