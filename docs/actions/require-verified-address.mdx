title: Require verified address

The `require_verified_address` action is used on login triggers. As the name suggests, this action requires users to have a
verified email address before they are able to sign in to the application.

For example, if you want to ensure that only users with a verified email address are able to access your application, you can use
the `require_verified_address` action on the login trigger. This action will check whether the user's email address has been
verified before allowing them to sign in. If the email address has not been verified, the user will not be able to sign in and
will receive an error message.

By using the `require_verified_address` action, you can improve the security of your application and ensure that only users with a
verified email address are able to access the application. This can help prevent unauthorized access and improve the overall
security of your application.
