Address verification ensures that a user’s email or phone number is valid and belongs to them. It helps prevent spam, ensures
delivery of important notifications, and maintains system integrity.

Ory supports these verification policies:

- Require verified addresses during sign up and/or login.
- Allow optional verification. Users can choose to verify their email or phone number, but it’s not required or enforced by the
  UI.

## Require verification on login

To require address verification at login, use the `require_verified_address` action. It requires at least one verified address for
the identity. You can enable it using either the Ory Console or CLI.

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="console" label="Ory Console" default>
```

1. Go to <ConsoleLink route="project.verification" />.
2. Enable **Require Verified Address for Login**.
3. Click **Save**.

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="cli" label="Ory CLI">
```

Run:

```shell
ory patch identity-config --project <project-id> --workspace <workspace-id> \
  --add '/selfservice/flows/login/after/password/hooks/0/hook="require_verified_address"'
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

:::note

If the identity schema defines multiple verifiable addresses, Ory sends a verification code to the first one and redirects the
user to the verification flow.

:::

If none of the identity's verifiable addresses are verified, a code will be sent to the first email or phone number in the list.
If at least one address is verified, Ory will not ask for verification.

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="Server rendered browser client">
```

For HTML form submissions, the `POST /self-service/login` endpoint responds with an HTTP 302 redirect to the verification flow.

```mdx-code-block
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="SPA & Native clients">
```

For AJAX (`Accept: application/json`) or native clients using `/self-service/login/api`, the endpoint responds with a 400 error:

```json
{
  "id": "session_verified_address_required",
  "code": 400,
  "status": "Bad Request",
  "reason": "Your account's email or phone address are not verified yet. Please check your email or phone inbox or re-request verification.",
  "details": {
    "continue_with": [
      {
        "action": "show_verification_ui",
        "flow": {
          "id": "7f4dfb3b-c3cc-4e35-9f09-286b09e77beb",
          "verifiable_address": "user@example.com",
          "url": "https://<your-slug>.projects.oryapis.com/verification?flow=7f4dfb3b-c3cc-4e35-9f09-286b09e77beb"
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  "message": "your email or phone address is not yet verified"
}
```

```mdx-code-block
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

### Legacy compatibility

Before May 2025, `require_verified_address` returned a 400 error without sending a verification code. This behavior is deprecated.
To re-enable it:

```shell
ory patch identity-config --project <project-id> --workspace <workspace-id> \
  --add '/feature_flags/legacy_require_verified_login_error=true'
```

The `verification` and `show_verification_ui` actions in login flows (but not sign up!) are also deprecated. Use
`require_verified_address` instead.

## Verification on sign up

Ory supports two options after sign up:

### Optional verification

Users sign up without address verification, but a code is sent. They can verify later. By default, Ory follows this behavior.

### Required verification

Users must verify their address before getting a session. After registration, they’re redirected to the verification flow.

:::note

If the identity schema includes multiple verifiable addresses, the code is sent to the first one.

:::

To enable this:

1. Go to <ConsoleLink route="project.verification" />.
2. Enable **Show verification screen after password registration**.

Or with the CLI:

```shell
ory patch identity-config "$PROJECT_ID" \
  --add '/selfservice/flows/registration/after/password/hooks/0/hook="show_verification_ui"' \
  --add '/selfservice/flows/registration/after/oidc/hooks/0/hook="show_verification_ui"' \
  --add '/selfservice/flows/registration/after/webauthn/hooks/0/hook="show_verification_ui"'
```

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="Server rendered browser client">
```

For browser clients using native forms, Ory redirects to the verification flow with HTTP 302.

```mdx-code-block
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="SPA & Native clients">
```

The registration endpoint returns a 400 error with a `continue_with` field that contains the verification flow:

```json
{
  "id": "...",
  "ui": {
    "action": "...",
    "method": "...",
    "nodes": [
      /* ... */
    ]
  },
  "continue_with": [
    {
      "action": "show_verification_ui",
      "flow": {
        "id": "d859f6af-1dfe-453e-9320-d572e10edeea",
        "verifiable_address": "example@ory.sh",
        "url": "https://ory.example.org/verification?flow=d859f6af-1dfe-453e-9320-d572e10edeea"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

```mdx-code-block
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

### Legacy compatibility

In projects created before May 2025, the registration response includes `continue_with` even if **Show verification screen after
password registration** is off.

To re-enable this legacy behavior:

```shell
ory patch identity-config --project <project-id> --workspace <workspace-id> \
  --add '/feature_flags/legacy_continue_with_verification_ui=true'
```

## Verification on address change

When a user updates their email address or phone number in the settings flow, Ory sends a verification code to the new address. By
default, the settings flow will display a success message when the profile is updated, but the address remains unverified until
the user completes the verification process.

### Show verification screen after address change

If you want users to be immediately redirected to verify their new address after changing it, you can configure the
`show_verification_ui` hook for the settings flow. This will redirect the user to the verification screen instead of showing a
success message.

To enable this behavior, use the Ory CLI:

```shell
ory patch identity-config {project_id} \
  --add '/selfservice/flows/settings/after/profile/hooks/0/hook="show_verification_ui"'
```

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="Server rendered browser client">
```

For browser clients using native forms, Ory redirects to the verification flow with HTTP 302.

```mdx-code-block
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="SPA & Native clients">
```

The settings endpoint returns a 400 error with a `continue_with` field that contains the verification flow:

```json
{
  "id": "...",
  "ui": {
    "action": "...",
    "method": "...",
    "nodes": [
      /* ... */
    ]
  },
  "continue_with": [
    {
      "action": "show_verification_ui",
      "flow": {
        "id": "d859f6af-1dfe-453e-9320-d572e10edeea",
        "verifiable_address": "example@ory.sh",
        "url": "https://ory.example.org/verification?flow=d859f6af-1dfe-453e-9320-d572e10edeea"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

```mdx-code-block
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
```
