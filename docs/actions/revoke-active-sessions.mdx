The `revoke_active_sessions` action is used to log out a user from all other active sessions. This ensures that every user has
exactly one active session and device at a time.

For example, if a user logs in to your application on multiple devices, the `revoke_active_sessions` action can be used to log out
the user from all other devices when they sign in on a new device. This ensures that the user is only able to access the
application from one device at a time and improves the overall security of your application.

The `revoke_active_session`s action can also be used to log out a user when they change their password or perform other
security-related actions. This ensures that the user is immediately logged out from all other devices and prevents unauthorized
access to the application.

By using the `revoke_active_sessions` action in combination with other security measures, you can ensure that users are only able
to access the application from one device at a time and improve the overall security of your application.
