title: Browser vs Native Apps
---

Ory Identities supports both mobile (native) and browser applications. Because of the broad capabilities browsers offer, they pose
a higher security risk than native applications. To shield your users from those risks, Ory Identities implements special browser
APIs which use additional security measures such as anti-CSRF cookies.

## Native Apps

Native apps use the `https://{project.slug}.projects.oryapis.com/self-service/{flow-type}/api` endpoint to initialize flows such
as sign in, registration, profile changes, and so on. When using this endpoint, no CSRF cookies will be issued by Ory.

Additionally, Ory issues an Ory Session Token instead of an Ory Session Cookie. This token is equivalent to the session cookie and
returns the same session response when calling `ory.toSession({ xSessionToken: "{session-token}" })`.

Because it is very dangerous to use native app endpoints in a browser context, Ory prevents you from using these APIs in the
browser.

## Browser Apps

Native apps use the `https://{project.slug}.projects.oryapis.com/self-service/{flow-type}/browser` endpoint to initialize flows
such as sign in, registration, profile changes, and so on. When using this endpoint, Ory will set anti CSRF cookies.

When a user signs in successfully, Ory will issue an Ory Session Cookie. Calling `ory.toSession()` will return the same session
but does not require any additional calls when used in client-side browser apps (for example React, Vue, Angular).
