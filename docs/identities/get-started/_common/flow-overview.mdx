Browser-based authentication flows in Ory use HTTP cookies to maintain user sessions securely. The flows follow these steps:

1. Your application redirects users to the appropriate Ory endpoint
2. Ory handles the authentication process and creates a session
3. Ory sets HTTP-only cookies to maintain the user's session
4. Your application verifies these cookies on subsequent requests
