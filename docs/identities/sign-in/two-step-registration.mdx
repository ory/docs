[Identity traits](../../kratos/manage-identities/managing-users-identities-metadata#traits) are data associated with an identity
that can be modified by the user. The traits are configured through the identity schema.

With unified registration - formerly called one-step legacy registration - the identity traits will be repeated for each
authentication strategy. For example the identity traits will be repeated for the password, the code via email, and the passkey
method. For this reason unified registration is recommended for use cases where you have only one or two authentication methods
enabled.

With a profile-first registration - formerly called two-step registration - the user is prompted for the identity traits in the
first step, and asked to choose a credential method for authentication next. This results in a more stream-lined user experience
when you have more than two authentication methods enabled.

To disable the one-step unified registration, Go to <ConsoleLink route="project.settings.advanced.route" /> and disable **Enable
unified sign up**.
