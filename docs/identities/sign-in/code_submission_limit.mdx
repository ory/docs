title:  Code submissions limit
---

A code is sent to a user controlled address (for example an email address) in some flows such as verification recovery, registration, etc.

It is important to find a balance between allowing a user to submit a wrong code multiple times, due for example to typos, and not
too many times, to prevent an attacker from brute-forcing the code.

To that end, a numeric limit can be configured. The
default is `5`. To prevent misconfiguration, this number is required to be between `1` and `255`. We recommend a rather small
number for security reasons, probably under 10. Organisations with strict security policies might set this number to `2` or `3`.

When the code is submitted too many times (that is to say, the configured limit is reached), the recovery flow fails.

To change the limit, go to [**Ory Console**](https://console.ory.sh/) â†’ **Authentication** -> **FIXME***, enter the desired number, and click the **Save** button.

1. Download the Ory Identities config from your project and save it to a file:

   ```shell
   ## List all available workspaces
   ory list workspaces

   ## List all available projects
   ory list projects --workspace <workspace-id>

   ## Get config
   ory get identity-config --project <project-id> --workspace <workspace-id> --format yaml > identity-config.yaml
   ```

2. Update the configuration value to the desired value:

   ```yaml title="config.yml"
   config:
       selfservice:
           methods:
               code:
                   // highlight-start
                   max_submissions: 3
                  // highlight-end
   ```

3. Update the Ory Identities configuration using the file you worked with:

   ```shell
   ory update identity-config --project <project-id> --workspace <workspace-id> --file identity-config.yaml
   ```
