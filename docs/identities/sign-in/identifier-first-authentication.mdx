Identifier first authentication first requests the user's identifier such as an email or username before prompting for a password
or other authentication methods.

:::note

Identifier first authentication is required when using B2B Organization login.

This guide explains how to enable and use identifier first authentication in Ory Network and self-hosted Ory Kratos.

## Ory Network

To enable it:

- 1. Log in to the [Ory Console](https://console.ory.com).
- 2. Select your project.
- 3. Navigate to <ConsoleLink route="project.accountExperience.theming.route" />.
- 4. Enable "Enable Account Experience 2.0 (preview)".
- 5. Navigate to <ConsoleLink route="project.ui.route" />
- 6. Click "Apply new UI URLs".
- 7. Test the flow in your application by navigating to the login page.

To revert, follow the same steps, disable "New Account Experience", and click "Reset to Account Experience".

## Self-hosted Ory Kratos

For Ory Enterprise License and Ory Apache 2.0 License users, set the following configuration in your `kratos.yaml` config file:

```yaml title="kratos-config.yaml"
selfservice:
  flows:
    login:
      style: identifier_first
```

To disable this feature, set `style` to `unified`.

## Account enumeration mitigation

Account enumeration mitigation prevents malicious actors from being able to identify if a user exists or not.

By default, Ory does not prevent account enumeration in the identifier first authentication flow. This improves user experience as
the user quickly knows if they have an account with the chosen identifier (email / username) or not. To enable account
enumeration, use the Ory CLI patch command

```shell
ory patch identity-config --project <project-id> --add '/security/account_enumeration/mitigate=true'
```

or if you use a config file, add the following to your `kratos.yaml` config file:

```yaml title="kratos-config.yaml"
security:
  account_enumeration:
    mitigate: true
```
