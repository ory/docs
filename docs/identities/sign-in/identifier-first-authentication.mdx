Identifier first authentication first requests the user's identifier such as an email or username before prompting for a password
or other authentication methods.

This guide explains how to enable and use identifier first authentication in Ory Network and self-hosted Ory Kratos.

## Ory Network

To enable it:

1. Log in to the [Ory Console](https://console.ory.sh).
2. Select your project.
3. Navigate to [Project Settings > Advanced](https://console.ory.sh/projects/current/settings/advanced).
4. Enable "New Account Experience".
5. Click "Save Changes".
6. Test the flow in your application by navigating to the login page.

To disable this feature, follow the same steps and disable "New Account Experience".

## Self-hosted Ory Kratos

For Ory Enterprise License and Ory Apache 2.0 License users, set the following configuration in your `kratos.yaml` config file:

```yaml title="kratos-config.yaml"
selfservice:
  flows:
    login:
      style: identifier_first
```

To disable this feature, set `style` to `unified`.
