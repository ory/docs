With a one-step login, when you enable multiple authentication strategies (for example password, code via email, and passkey), the
identity traits will be repeated for each authentication strategy.

Compare this to a two-step login: Now, the user is prompted for the identity traits in the first step, and asked to choose a
credential method for authentication next. This results in a more stream-lined user experience.

:::info

Identity traits are data associated with an identity that can be modified by the user. The traits are configured through the
identity schema.

To disable the legacy one-step login, go to https://console.ory.sh/projects/current/authentication and switch off "Enable legacy
one-step login" or use the Ory CLI:

```bash
ory list projects # to get the project id

ory patch project ${project_id} \
  --replace '/services/identity/config/selfservice/flows/login/enable_legacy_one_step=false'
```
