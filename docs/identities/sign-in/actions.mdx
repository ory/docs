## Customize login and registration behavior

You can customize login and registration flows using Ory Actions. This includes calling external services or logic with webhooks
and triggering logic that is built-in to Ory, such requiring a verified email address to sign in.

### Trigger external logic with webhooks

Make webhook calls to third-party service providers when users sign up or sign in:

- [Mailchimp](../../actions/integrations/hubspot.mdx)
- [Segment](../../actions/integrations/mailchimp.mdx)
- [Hubspot](../../actions/integrations/segment.mdx)
- Other [webhook targets](../../guides/integrate-with-ory-cloud-through-webhooks.mdx)

#### Control who registers with additional validation

Use Ory Actions to add extra validation that allows you to control exactly who can sign up. For example, you can prevent users
from signing up when:

- their email domain doesn't match a certain value - this way you can allow only users from certain organizations to sign up.
- their IP address isn't allowed. This way you can prevent user registrations from locales where you don't provide services.
- they used an invalid invite code or invite password to sign up. This way you can ensure that newly registered users don't get
  access to expired content or functionality.

Use flow-interrupting webhooks to add this validation to sign-up and registration flows.

Read the
[Flow-interrupting webhooks documentation](../../guides/integrate-with-ory-cloud-through-webhooks.mdx#flow-interrupting-webhooks)
to learn more.

### Revoke previously issued sessions at login

You can revoke all of the user's active session when they log in to your system. This allows the users to have only one active
session, and ensures that they access your services from one point of entry (a device, a browser) at a time.

To enable this behavior, use the [Ory CLI](../../guides/cli/01_installation.mdx).

Run this command to revoke all active sessions of the user after every login:

```shell
ory patch identity-config {project_id} \
  --add '/selfservice/flows/login/after/hooks=[{"hook": "revoke_active_sessions"}]'
```

To use this feature only for specific methods, run this command:

```shell
ory patch identity-config {project_id} \
  --add '/selfservice/flows/login/after/password/hooks=[{"hook": "revoke_active_sessions"}]' \
  --add '/selfservice/flows/login/after/oidc/hooks=[{"hook": "revoke_active_sessions"}]' \
  --add '/selfservice/flows/login/after/webauthn/hooks=[{"hook": "revoke_active_sessions"}]'
```

#### Disable session revocation

Follow these steps to disable session revocation on login:

1. List all configured hooks for the `after` login method:

   ```shell
   ory get identity-config {project_id} \
     --format=jsonpath='selfservice.flows.login.after'
   ```

2. Check the JSON output and identify the array index of the `revoke_active_sessions` hook:

   ```json5
   {
     hooks: [
       {
         hook: "some_other_hook", // The index of this hook is '0'.
       },
       {
         hook: "revoke_active_sessions", // The index of this hook is '1'.
       },
     ],
     oidc: {
       hooks: [],
     },
     password: {
       hooks: [],
     },
     webauthn: {
       hooks: [],
     },
   }
   ```

3. Remove the hook by passing the hook index in the command:

   ```shell
   ory patch identity-config {project_id} \
     --remove '/selfservice/flows/login/after/hooks/1'
   ```

### Allow login only with verified email

To allow only the users with a verified email to sign in, follow these steps:

1. Go to Ory Console → [**Email Verification**](https://console.ory.sh/projects/current/verification).
2. Toggle **Require Verified Address for Login** to switch on the feature.

:::info

Ory doesn't recommend requiring a verified email to sign in. If you want to encourage users to verify their addresses, show a
banner and limit functionality for unverified accounts. This approach helps improve signup conversion.

:::

#### First sign in without verification

If sessions are issued after registration, users will be signed in after registration, but will need to verify their email address
before they can sign in using other devices or browsers and get more active sessions as a result.

### Log in users after registration

When you enable this behavior, users get a session after they sign up. This means that they don't have to sign in with their newly
created account to get access to your services, but instead can access all the features immediately.

1. Go to Ory Console → [**Base Settings**](https://console.ory.sh/projects/current/auth).
2. Toggle **Sign In After Registration**.

## Show verification after successful registration

If you want to show the verification screen after registration, follow these steps:

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="Server rendered browser client">
```

For server rendered applications, such as an Express.js app, or when using the Ory Account Experience, Ory Identities can be
configured to redirect to the verification screen automatically after registration.

1. Go to Ory Console → [**Email Verification**](https://console.ory.sh/projects/current/verification).
2. Toggle **Show verification screen** for the respective methods.

Or using the [Ory CLI](../../guides/cli/01_installation.mdx):

```shell
ory patch identity-config {project_id} \
  --add '/selfservice/flows/registration/after/password/hooks=[{"hook": "show_verification_ui"}]' \
  --add '/selfservice/flows/registration/after/oidc/hooks=[{"hook": "show_verification_ui"}]' \
  --add '/selfservice/flows/registration/after/webauthn/hooks=[{"hook": "show_verification_ui"}]'
```

:::note

If your identity schema defines multiple verifiable addresses, Ory Identities redirects to the verification flow of only one of
the addresses.

:::

```mdx-code-block
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="SPA & Native clients">
```

For SPA and native clients, the response from the registration endpoint contains a `continue_with` field. This field lists
possible actions, the user might need to or can take next. For example, an object containing the ID of the verification flow
created as part of the registration flow:

```json
{
  "continue_with": [
    {
      "action": "show_verification_ui",
      "flow": {
        "id": "d859f6af-1dfe-453e-9320-d572e10edeea",
        "verifiable_address": "example@ory.sh"
      }
    }
    // Other items
  ]
}
```

You can use this ID to fetch the verification flow information, using the
[`getVerificationFlow`](../../reference/api#tag/frontend/operation/getVerificationFlow) API method.

:::note

The response from the registration endpoint always contains the `continue_with` field with the `verification_ui` action, if
verification is enabled and the identity schema defines at least one verifiable address. Because of this, the
`show_verification_ui` hook has no effect for API and SPA clients.
