Some Social Sign-in Providers such as Google or GitHub show the Redirect URL as part of the sign-in process:

By default, Ory Network uses a redirect URL that points to the Ory Network domain.

:::caution

Changing the `base_redirect_uri` will break previously existing and functional social sign-in connections.

To fix a broken connection, choose the provider you want to fix from the Ory Console social sign-in configuration screen and copy
the redirect URL. You need to replace the Ory Network URL with your custom hostname. Use this URL to update the redirect URL
configuration of the social sign-in provider.

:::

This makes it easy to get started with Social Sign-in. To adjust the redirect URL to your custom domain, you need to update the
`base_redirect_uri`:

```shell
## List all available projects
ory list projects

## Remove the configuration entry
ory patch identity-config <project-id> \
  --add '/selfservice/methods/oidc/config/base_redirect_uri="https://ory.example.org"'
```
