This guide explains how to authenticate native apps. This includes:

- Apps for mobile phones written in, for example, Swift, Android, React Native, Cordova, or Ionic
- Command line interface applications
- Devices or apps without a browser

:::info

Ory's native app APIs don't use HTTP redirects and HTTP cookies but instead fully rely on bearer tokens, JSON and REST.

:::

These apps use the native API to:

- sign users in with the `createNativeLoginFlow()` method
- register users with the `createNativeRegistrationFlow()` method
- change user settings with the `createNativeSettingsFlow()` method
- recover user accounts with the`createNativeRecoveryFlow()` method
- verify user accounts with the `createNativeVerificationFlow()` method

Native apps receive Ory Session Tokens instead of an Ory Session Cookie. The token is used to look up the user.

## Check session token in React Native

```mdx-code-block
import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock'
import reactNative from '!!raw-loader!../../../code-examples/identity/sign-in/check-session/js/react-native.tsx'

<CodeBlock language="tsx">{reactNative}</CodeBlock>
```

## User interfaces

Check out the [React Native quickstart](../../getting-started/integrate-auth/react-native.mdx) to learn how to build your own
native UI for sign-in, registration, recovery, verification, and account settings.
