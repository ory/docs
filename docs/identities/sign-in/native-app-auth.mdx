# Native app login and registration

This guide explains how to authenticate native apps. This includes:

- Apps for mobile phones written in Swift, Android, React Native, Cordova, Ionic, and so on
- Command line interface applications (CLIs)
- Devices or apps without a browser

:::info

Ory's native app APIs do not use HTTP redirects and HTTP cookies but instead fully rely on bearer tokens, JSON and REST.

:::

These apps use the native API to sign in `createNativeLoginFlow()`, register `createNativeRegistrationFlow()`, change settings
`createNativeSettingsFlow()`, and so on. Native apps receive an Ory session token instead of an Ory session cookie. The session
token is used to look up the user.

## Check session token

```mdx-code-block
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
import { getSdkUrl } from '@site/src/hooks'
import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock'
import CodeFromRemote from '@theme/CodeFromRemote'
import reactNative from '!!raw-loader!../../../code-examples/identity/sign-in/check-session/js/react-native.tsx'

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="react-native" label="React Native" default>
    <CodeBlock language="tsx">{reactNative}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="curl" label="curl">


Read the [check login session](check-session-token-cookie-api) documentation for more details about authentication native apps.


  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

## User interfaces

:::note

[Ory elements](https://github.com/ory/elements) is not yet available for native apps.

:::

Check out the [React Native quickstart](../../getting-started/integrate-auth/react-native.mdx) to learn how to build your own
native UI for sign in, registration, recovery, verification, and account settings.
