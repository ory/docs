This guide explains how to authenticate native apps. This includes:

- Apps for mobile phones written in, for example, Swift, Android, React Native, Cordova, or Ionic
- Command line interface applications
- Devices or apps without a browser

:::info

Ory's native app APIs don't use HTTP redirects and HTTP cookies but instead fully rely on bearer tokens, JSON and REST.

:::

These apps use the native API to sign in `createNativeLoginFlow()`, register `createNativeRegistrationFlow()`, change settings
`createNativeSettingsFlow()`, `createNativeRecoveryFlow()`, and `createNativeVerificationFlow()`. Native apps receive an Ory Session Token instead of an Ory Session Cookie. The
token is used to look up the user.

## Check session token in React Native

```mdx-code-block
import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock'
import reactNative from '!!raw-loader!../../../code-examples/identity/sign-in/check-session/js/react-native.tsx'

<CodeBlock language="tsx">{reactNative}</CodeBlock>
```

## User interfaces

Check out the [React Native quickstart](../../getting-started/integrate-auth/react-native.mdx) to learn how to build your own
native UI for sign-in, registration, recovery, verification, and account settings.
