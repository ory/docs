# Identity schema selection for self-service registration and login flows

Ory Kratos now supports selecting an identity schema during registration and login self-service flows by specifying a
query parameter. This gives administrators more control over which schemas are used and allows multi-tenant or multi-profile
setups with distinct identity models.

This feature is available in **Ory Kratos OEL** for now and will be available in Ory Network soon.

## Overview

- Users or integrators can choose which schema to use by appending the `identity_schema` query parameter when initiating
  registration or login flows.
- Only schemas explicitly marked as selectable via `selfservice_selectable: true` in the configuration will be accepted.
- If no schema is selected, the default schema is used (this is the existing behavior).

## How to Use

### Registration Example

**Browser flow:**

```
GET /self-service/registration/browser?identity_schema=schema-a
```

**API flow:**

```
GET /self-service/registration/api?identity_schema=schema-a
```

### Login Example

**Browser flow:**

```
GET /self-service/login/browser?identity_schema=schema-a
```

**API flow:**

```
GET /self-service/login/api?identity_schema=schema-a
```

## Configuration

You must define which schemas are available for self-service selection by using the `selfservice_selectable` flag in your identity
schema configuration.

### Example Configuration

```yaml
identity:
  default_schema_id: default
  schemas:
    - id: default
      url: file://./schemas/default.schema.json
      selfservice_selectable: true

    - id: schema-a
      url: file://./schemas/schema-a.schema.json
      selfservice_selectable: true

    - id: schema-internal
      url: file://./schemas/internal.schema.json
      selfservice_selectable: false # This one cannot be selected by end users
```

Only schemas where `selfservice_selectable: true` will be selectable via the `identity_schema` parameter.

## Behavior Summary

- If a schema is listed and marked as selectable, it can be used in registration/login.
- If a schema is not listed or not marked as selectable, it cannot be used via query param.
- If no `identity_schema` is passed, the default schema (`default_schema_id`) is used.

## Migration Notes

- This feature is non-breaking. Existing flows using the default schema are unaffected.
- You only need to update configuration if you want to expose multiple schemas for selection.
- Schemas used internally can remain non-selectable, for example for admin or machine users.
