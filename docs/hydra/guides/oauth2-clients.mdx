title: Managing OAuth 2.0 clients
---

You can manage OAuth 2.0 clients using the CLI or the HTTP REST API:

- **CLI:** `hydra help clients`
- **REST:** Read the [API Docs](../reference/api.mdx)

## Authorize Code Flow with Refresh Token

The following command creates an OAuth 2.0 Client capable of executing the Authorize Code Flow, requesting ID and Refresh Tokens
and performing the OAuth 2.0 Refresh Grant:

```sh
hydra create client \
  --endpoint http://ory-hydra:4445 \
  --grant-type authorization_code,refresh_token \
  --response-type code \
  --scope openid,offline \
  --redirect-uri http://my-app.com/callback,http://my-other-app.com/callback
```

The OAuth 2.0 Client will be allowed to use values `http://my-app.com/callback` and `http://my-other-app.com/callback` as
`redirect_url`.

> It's expected that the OAuth 2.0 Client sends its credentials using HTTP Basic Authorization.

If you wish to send credentials in the POST Body, add the following flag to the command above:

```
    --token-endpoint-auth-method client_secret_post \
```

The same can be achieved by setting `"token_endpoint_auth_method": "client_secret_post"` in the request body of `POST /clients`
and `PUT /clients/<id>`.

## Client credentials flow

A client only capable of performing the Client Credentials Flow can be created as follows:

```
hydra create client \
  --endpoint http://ory-hydra:4445 \
  -g client_credentials
```
