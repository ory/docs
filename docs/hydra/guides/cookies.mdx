title: Configuring cookies
---

By default, cookies sent by Ory Hydra's API are set without explicitly specifying a SameSite mode. If you wish for these cookies
to be set with a mode you can use the `serve.cookies.same_site_mode` setting. Possible values are `Strict`, `Lax` or `None`:

```yaml
serve:
  cookies:
    same_site_mode: Strict
```

If you wish to embed requests to hydra on a third party site (for example an iframe that periodically polls to check session
status) you will need to set the mode to `None`. Some
[browser versions](https://www.chromium.org/updates/same-site/incompatible-clients) reject cookies using the `Same-Site=None`
attribute. Hydra implements a [workaround](https://web.dev/samesite-cookie-recipes/#handling-incompatible-clients) that can be
enabled by setting `serve.cookies.same_site_legacy_workaround` to `true`. This workaround is disabled by default, and only takes
effect when `serve.cookies.same_site_mode` is set to `None`:

```yaml
# SameSite=none requires HTTPS, so we need to disable dev mode:
dev: false

serve:
  cookies:
    same_site_mode: None
    same_site_legacy_workaround: true
```

To set the cookie domain, use the `serve.cookies.domain` setting:

```yaml
serve:
  cookies:
    domain: example.com
```

To set the cookie names, use the `serve.cookies.names` setting:

```yaml
serve:
  cookies:
    names:
      login_csrf: login_name
      consent_csrf: consent_name
      session: session_name
```
