When using Ory OAuth2 and OpenID Connect, the default logout experience is the managed account experience. However, it's possible
to customize the logout experience by implementing a custom logout endpoint using the Ory SDK. In this guide, we will walk through
the steps of implementing your own logout endpoint and customizing the logout UI.

## OpenID Connect logout overview

OpenID Connect defines two types of logout mechanisms: backchannel logout and frontchannel logout. Backchannel logout is initiated
by the identity provider (IdP) and is a server-to-server call. Frontchannel logout, on the other hand, is initiated by the client
and is a client-to-server call.

## Customize logout experience

To customize the logout experience, we need to implement a custom logout endpoint that can handle backchannel and frontchannel
logout requests. The Logout HTML Form can't be a Single Page App (Client-side browser application) or a Mobile App! There has to
be a server-side component with access to an Ory API Key.

To get started, you can check out the reference implementation of this endpoint provided by Ory Hydra. The code is available on
GitHub at https://github.com/ory/hydra-login-consent-node.

The reference implementation includes the necessary code to handle backchannel and frontchannel logout requests, as well as a
basic UI for the logout page. However, you can customize the UI to fit your needs.

## Code example

To implement your own logout endpoint using the Ory SDK, you can use the following code as a starting point:

```mdx-code-block
import revokeClient from '!!raw-loader!../../../code-examples/sdk/typescript/src/oauth2/logout.ts'
import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock'

<CodeBlock language="js">{revokeClient}</CodeBlock>
```

This code handles both backchannel and frontchannel logout requests, as well as redirects the user to the homepage after logout.

## Mermaid diagram

The following Mermaid diagram illustrates the flow of a logout request:

```mdx-code-block
import Mermaid from "@site/src/theme/Mermaid";
