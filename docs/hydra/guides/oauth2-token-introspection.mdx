Token introspection is a mechanism for resource servers to obtain information about access tokens. With this specification,
resource servers can check the validity of access tokens and discover other information, such as which user and which scopes are
associated with the token.

:::important

Token introspection is meant for first-party or internal use only. The endpoint shouldn't be exposed publicly.
