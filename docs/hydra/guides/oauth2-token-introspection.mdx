Token introspection is a mechanism for resource servers to obtain information about access tokens. With this spec, resource
servers can check the validity of access tokens and find out other information such as which user and which scopes are associated
with the token.

:::important

Token introspection is meant for first-party or internal use only. The endpoint shouldn't be exposed publicly.
