Token introspection is a mechanism for resource servers to obtain information about access tokens. With this
spec, resource servers can check the validity of access tokens, and find out other information such as which user and which scopes
are associated with the token.

:::important

Token Introspection is meant for first-party / internal use only. The endpoint shouldn't be exposed publicly.
