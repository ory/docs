title: Setting up Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)
---

Both Ory Hydra's Admin and Public endpoints support CORS. For detailed information, head over to the exemplary
[config file](https://github.com/ory/hydra/blob/master/docs/config.yaml).

For CORS to work properly, we encourage to set the following values:

```yaml
serve:
  admin:
    cors:
      enabled: true
      allowed_origins:
        - https://example.com
        - https://*.example.com
      allowed_methods:
        - POST
        - GET
        - PUT
        - PATCH
        - DELETE
      allowed_headers:
        - Authorization
      exposed_headers:
        - Content-Type
  public:
    cors:
      enabled: true
      allowed_origins:
        - https://example.com
        - https://*.example.com
      allowed_methods:
        - POST
        - GET
        - PUT
        - PATCH
        - DELETE
      allowed_headers:
        - Authorization
      exposed_headers:
        - Content-Type
```

Keep in mind that the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Endpoint (`/oauth2/auth`) doesn't expose CORS by design. This endpoint should never
be consumed in a CORS-fashion. Some endpoints (`/oauth2/token`, `/userinfo`, `/oauth2/revoke`) also include URLs listed in field
`allowed_cors_origins` of the OAuth 2.0 Client that is making the request. For example, OAuth 2.0 Client

```json
{
  "client_id": "foo",
  "allowed_cors_origins": ["https://foo-bar.com/"]
}
```

is allowed to make CORS request to `/oauth2/token` from origin `https://foo-bar.com/` even if that origin isn't listed in
`public.cors.allowed_origins`.
