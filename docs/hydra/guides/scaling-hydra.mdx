title: Scaling Ory Hydra
---

Ory Hydra is running in high-scale production environments that do millions of requests per day. To scale Ory Hydra, simply spin
up another VM / Docker Container / Pod of Ory Hydra with the same configuration. There is no need for complex key/value stores or
message queues to serve high traffic environments!
