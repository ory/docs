There are two types of audience concepts in OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect:

- **OAuth 2.0 access token audience:** OAuth 2.0 access tokens are "internal-facing". In other words, the `aud` claim of an OAuth
  2.0 access token defines the endpoints at which the token can be used.
- **OpenID Connect ID token audience:** OpenID Connect ID tokens are "external-facing". The `aud` claim of an OpenID Connect ID
  Token defines which clients should accept it.

## Add audiences to the client allow list

To specify the intended audiences for an OAuth 2.0 access token, the OAuth 2.0 client needs to proactively define the audiences it
needs access to when creating or updating the client. This can be done by including the audience parameter in the client's
metadata.

The `audience` parameter is a list of case-sensitive URLs. The URLs can't contain whitespaces.

```json5
{
  client_id: "...",
  // ..
  audience: ["https://api.my-cloud.com/user", "https://some-tenant.my-cloud.com/"],
  // ..
}
```

If you're a developer looking to manage OAuth2 clients, you can find more information in the
[Manage OAuth2 Clients document](./oauth2-clients.mdx).

## Audience in Authorization Code, Implicit, and hybrid flows

When performing an OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Grant, Implicit Grant, or hybrid flow, developers can request audiences at the
`/oauth2/auth` endpoint using the `audience` query parameter:

```text
https://$PROJECT_SLUG.projects.oryapis.com/oauth2/auth
  ?client_id=...
  &scope=...
  &audience=https://api.my-cloud.com/user+https://some-tenant.my-cloud.com/
```

The `audience` query parameter can contain multiple strings separated by a URL-encoded space (`+` or `%20`). The audience values
must also be URL-encoded.

The values are validated against the allowed audiences defined in the OAuth 2.0 client. For instance, if an OAuth 2.0 client
allows the audience `https://api.my-cloud/user`, it can request audience values like `https://api.my-cloud/user` or
`https://api.my-cloud/user/1234`, but not `https://api.my-cloud/not-user` or `https://something-else/`.

The requested audience from the query parameter is then part of the login and consent request payload as the field
`requested_access_token_audience`. Developers can then alter the audience using `grant_audience.access_token` when accepting the
consent request. For example:

```mdx-code-block
import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock'
import tsExample from '!!raw-loader!../../../code-examples/sdk/typescript/src/oauth2/consent-audience.ts'

<CodeBlock language="tsx">{tsExample}</CodeBlock>
```

When introspecting the OAuth 2.0 Access Token, the response payload includes the audience:

```mdx-code-block
import audExample from '!!raw-loader!../../../code-examples/sdk/typescript/src/oauth2/token-introspect-audience.ts'

<CodeBlock language="tsx">{audExample}</CodeBlock>
```

## Audiences in Client Credentials Grant

When performing the Client Credentials Grant, the `audience` parameter from the POST body of the `/oauth2/token` request is
decoded and validated according to the rules described in the previous section, excluding login and consent, which are not a part
of this flow.
