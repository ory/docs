### Creating a public OAuth 2.0 Client

You can create a public OAuth 2.0 Client (for example for the authorize code + PKCE or implicit flow) with the CLI

```
hydra clients create --endpoint http://ory-hydra-admin-api --token-endpoint-auth-method none
```

or by setting in the HTTP API JSON body when POSTing to `/clients`:

```
{
  "client_id": "...",
  "token_endpoint_auth_method": "none"
}
```

Be aware that when making requests to `/oauth2/token` or `/oauth2/revoke` with a public OAuth 2.0 Client, you can't authenticate
with the HTTP Basic Authorization but must include the `client_id` in the POST body:

```
POST /oauth2/token
...

client_id=...&
  ...
```

:::note

The public clients using a non-https redirect scheme can't skip consent as per OpenID Specification & Certification.
