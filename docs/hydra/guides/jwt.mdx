JSON Web Token (JWT) for OAuth 2.0 Client Authentication and Authorization Grants is an extension to OAuth2 framework. It allows a
client to send a signed JWT token to an OpenID Connect Provider in exchange for an OAuth 2.0 access token.

## Usage scenario

ELECTRO, an electric company that needs to receive automatic monthly payments from a customer's online bank account uses this
extension. If the electric company and the online bank have a trusted relationship, ELECTRO can send a signed JWT token with the
required claims to the OpenID Connect Provider configured for the online bank to request an OAuth 2.0 access token each month.
ELECTRO can then use the access token to cash the monthly payments from the online bank.

## Ory JWT profile capabilities

Ory supports both methods for using JWTs as authorization grants and client authentication described in
[RFC 7523](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7523):

- Using JWTs as authorization grants allows exchanging JSON Web Tokens for access tokens using an established trust relationship.
- Using JWTs for client authenticationa allows OAuth 2.0 client authentication using public/private keys via JSON Web Tokens.

## Using JWTs as Authorization Grants

To use the `urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer` Authorization Grant, the client must make an OAuth 2.0 access token
request using the following specific parameter values and encodings:

- `grant_type` value must be `urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer`.
- The `assertion` parameter must contain a single JWT.

You can also add the `scope` parameter to indicate the requested scope:

```curl
POST /oauth2/token HTTP/1.1
Host: {project.slug}.projects.oryapis.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

scope=foo+bar
&grant_type=urn%3Aietf%3Aparams%3Aoauth%3Agrant-type%3Ajwt-bearer
&assertion=eyJhbGciOiJFUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6IjE2In0.
eyJpc3Mi[...].
J9l-ZhwP[...]
```

### Establishing a trust relationship

Before using this grant type, a trust relationship must be established in Ory OAuth2 and OpenID Connect. There are two types of
trust relationships:

- Trust relationships restricted to a single subject. This means that the issuer is only allowed to sign JWTs for the trusted
  subject.
- Trust relationships that allow issuing tokens for any subject. While this can be useful to implement a secure
  token service, it gives the issuer the ability to impersonate any user. As such, this relationship should only be established if
  the issuer is as trusted as your own Ory OAuth2 and OpenID Connect instance.

Restricted trust relationships require registering the issuer, subject, and the public key using the Ory SDK:

```mdx-code-block
import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock'
import trustExample from '!!raw-loader!../../../code-examples/sdk/typescript/src/oauth2/trust.ts'

<CodeBlock language="tsx">{trustExample}</CodeBlock>
```

::tip

You can also [delete](../../reference/api#tag/oAuth2/operation/deleteTrustedOAuth2JwtGrantIssuer),
[get](../../reference/api#tag/oAuth2/operation/getTrustedOAuth2JwtGrantIssuer), and
[list](../../reference/api#tag/oAuth2/operation/listTrustedOAuth2JwtGrantIssuers) trust relationships.

### Exchanging JWT assertion for access token

To exchange a JWT for an access token at the OAuth2 token endpoint, you send a POST request to the OAuth2 token endpoint with the
following parameters:

- `grant_type`: set to `urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer`
- `assertion`: the JWT, which should be passed in the request body or in the `assertion` parameter of the request body.

The JWT has the following scopes:

  nbf: 1300815780,
  exp: 1300819380,
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
````

In the example above, the JWT is passed in the `assertion` parameter of the request body. The `grant_type` parameter is set to
`urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer` to indicate the exchange of a JWT for an access token.

The OAuth2 token endpoint will then verify the signature of the JWT and check the claims to ensure that it is valid. If the JWT is
valid, the OAuth2 token endpoint will issue an access token that can be used to access protected resources:

```json5 title="Example claims of JSON Web Token"
{
  iss: "https://{project.slug}.projects.oryapis.com/",
  sub: "7146dd0b-f243-43ba-815c-7a00216b4823",
  scp: ["read"],
  // ...
}
```

### JWT assertion validation requirements

When using the `urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer` Authorization Grant, the assertion parameter's JWT is validated
through the following steps:

- The JWT must contain an `iss` (issuer) claim that has a unique identifier for the entity that issued the JWT. This value should
  match the `issuer` value of the trust relationship.
- The JWT must contain a `sub` (subject) claim that identifies the principal as the subject of the JWT (e.g., the user ID). This
  value should match the `subject` value of the trust relationship unless `allow_any_subject` is `true`.
- The JWT must contain an `aud` (audience) claim with a value that identifies the authorization server as an intended audience.
  The value should be the OAuth2 Token URL.
- The JWT must contain an `exp` (expiration time) claim that restricts the time window during which the JWT can be used. This can
  be controlled through the `/oauth2/grant/jwt/max_ttl` setting.
- The JWT may contain an `nbf` (not before) claim that identifies the time before which the token must not be accepted for
  processing by Ory.
- The JWT may contain an `iat` (issued at) claim that identifies the time at which the JWT was issued. This can be controlled
  through the `/oauth2/grant/jwt/iat_optional` (default `false`) setting. If iat is not provided, the current time (when Ory
  receives the assertion) will be considered the issued date.
- The JWT may contain a `jti` (JWT ID) claim that provides a unique identifier for the token. This can be controlled through the
  `/oauth2/grant/jwt/jti_optional` (default `false`) setting. Note that if jti is required, Ory will reject all assertions with
  the same `jti` if `jti` was already used by some assertion, and this assertion is not expired yet (see `exp` claim).
- The JWT signature is verified using the JSON Web Key registered in the trust relationship.
- If a scope was included in the OAuth2 access token request, it will be validated against the allowed scope in the trust
  relationship.

### Configuring JWT validation parameters

To configure the `/oauth2/grant/jwt/jti_optional`, `/oauth2/grant/jwt/iat_optional`, and `/oauth2/grant/jwt/max_ttl` settings
using the Ory CLI, follow the example below:

```shell
ory patch oauth2-config \
  --replace "/oauth2/grant/jwt/jti_optional=true" \
  --replace "/oauth2/grant/jwt/iat_optional=true" \
  --replace "/oauth2/grant/jwt/max_ttl=1h"
```

## JWTs for client authentication

Ory provides support for OAuth 2.0 Client Authentication with RSA and ECDSA private/public key pairs and supports signing
algorithms such as RS256, RS384, RS512, PS256, PS384, PS512, ES256, ES384, ES512, and EdDSA. This method of authentication
replaces the classic HTTP Basic Authorization and HTTP POST Authorization schemes. Instead of sending the `client_id` and
`client_secret`, you authenticate the client with a signed JSON Web Token.

To use this feature for a specific OAuth 2.0 Client, set the `token_endpoint_auth_method` to `private_key_jwt` and register the
public key of the RSA/ECDSA signing key either using the `jwks_uri` or `jwks` fields of the client.

When authenticating the client at the token endpoint, generate and sign (with the RSA/ECDSA private key) a JSON Web Token with the
following claims:

- `iss`: REQUIRED. Issuer. This claim MUST contain the client_id of the OAuth Client.
- `sub`: REQUIRED. Subject. This claim MUST contain the client_id of the OAuth Client.
- `aud`: REQUIRED. Audience. The `aud` (audience) Claim is a value that identifies the Authorization Server (Ory) as an intended
  audience. The Authorization Server MUST verify that it's an intended audience for the token. The Audience SHOULD be the URL of
  the Authorization Server's Token Endpoint.
- `jti`: REQUIRED. JWT ID. This is a unique identifier for the token, which can be used to prevent reuse of the token. These
  tokens MUST only be used once, unless conditions for reuse were negotiated between the parties; any such negotiation is beyond
  the scope of this specification.
- `exp`: REQUIRED. Expiration time on or after which the ID Token MUST NOT be accepted for processing.
- `iat`: OPTIONAL. Time at which the JWT was issued.

To make a request to the `/oauth2/token` endpoint, include

```
client_assertion_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-bearer
```

and

```
client_assertion=<signed-jwt>
```

in the request body:

```
POST /oauth2/token HTTP/1.1
Host: {project.slug}.projects.oryapis.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

grant_type=authorization_code&
code=i1WsRn1uB1&
client_id=s6BhdRkqt3&
client_assertion_type=
urn%3Aietf%3Aparams%3Aoauth%3Aclient-assertion-type%3Ajwt-bearer&
client_assertion=PHNhbWxwOl ... ZT
```

### Registering the client's public key

To configure the public key for an OAuth2 client in order to verify the signature of the authentication JWT, you need to do the
following:

1. Generate an RSA or ECDSA key pair. The private key will be used by the client to sign JWTs, and the public key will be used by
   the authorization server to verify the signatures.
2. Register the public key with the OAuth2 client. This can be done using the `jwks_uri` or `jwks` fields of the client. The
   `jwks_uri` is a URL that points to a JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) that contains the public key. The `jwks` field is a direct JSON
   object representation of the JWKS.

Here is an example of how to register an RSA public key for an OAuth2 client:

```mdx-code-block
import jwkExample from '!!raw-loader!../../../code-examples/sdk/typescript/src/oauth2/client-create-jwk.ts'

<CodeBlock language="tsx">{jwkExample}</CodeBlock>
```

Note that the `kid` field (key ID) should be a unique identifier for the public key. This is used by the authorization server to
identify which key to use to verify the signature of the JWT. If you have multiple keys, you should use a different `kid` for each
key.

Once the public key has been registered, the OAuth2 client can use its private key to sign JWTs, and the authorization server can
use the public key to verify the signatures.
