# OAuth2 webhooks

```mdx-code-block
import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem'
```

The Hydra OAuth2 and OpenID Connect server comes with a mechanism that allows updating `id_token` and `access_token` when a
registered client sends a token request. The flow is realized by calling the defined token hook endpoint which returns updated
data.

If the data provided by the webhook is different from the data the client sends, the webhook overwrites the session data with a
new set.

:::note

The hook is called before any other logic is executed. If the hook execution fails, the entire token flow fails.

:::

## Configuration

You can use hooks feature with all grant types.

Use the Ory CLI with following keys to enable this feature:

```shell title="Enable the generic token hook"
ory patch oauth2-config {project.id} \
  --add "/oauth2/token_hook=\"https://my-example.app/token-hook\"" \
  --format yaml
```

### Webhook payload

The token hook endpoint must accept the following payload format:

```json
{
  "session": {
    "id_token": {
      "id_token_claims": {
        "jti": "",
        "iss": "http://localhost:4444/",
        "sub": "subject",
        "aud": ["app-client"],
        "nonce": "",
        "at_hash": "",
        "acr": "1",
        "amr": null,
        "c_hash": "",
        "ext": {}
      },
      "headers": {
        "extra": {}
      },
      "username": "",
      "subject": "foo"
    },
    "extra": {},
    "client_id": "app-client",
    "consent_challenge": "",
    "exclude_not_before_claim": false,
    "allowed_top_level_claims": []
  },
  "request": {
    "client_id": "app-client",
    "granted_scopes": ["offline", "openid", "hydra.*"],
    "granted_audience": [],
    "grant_types": ["authorization_code"],
    "payload": {}
  }
}
```

:::note

`session` represents the consent session, along with the data that was passed to the
[Accept Consent Request](https://www.ory.sh/docs/hydra/reference/api#operation/acceptConsentRequest) in the `id_token` field.
`request` is the token request context.

:::

### Requester payload

For `jwt-bearer` grant type the `assertion` value is also sent to the webhook URL.

Here's the format of the `request.payload:

```json
{
  "assertion": ["eyJhbGciOiJIUzI..."]
}
```

:::note

For `authorization_code` and `refresh_token` grant types, the `request.payload` is always empty.

:::

#### Webhook responses

To update the data, the webhook must return a `200 OK` response and the updated session data in the following format:

```json
{
  "session": {
    "access_token": {
      "foo": "bar"
    },
    "id_token": {
      "bar": "baz"
    }
  }
}
```

Alternatively, you can choose not to update the session data by returning a `204 No Content` response.

:::note

The token subject is never overridden.

:::

### Updated tokens

The following examples show fragments of tokens issued after the webhook call:

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="id_token" label="id_token" default>
    <CodeBlock language="json">{`
{
  "aud": [
    "my_client"
  ],
  "auth_time": 1647427485,
  "bar": "baz",
  "iss": "http://ory.hydra.example/",
  "sub": "foo@bar.com"
}
    `}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="access_token" label="access_token">
    <CodeBlock language="json">{`
{
  "active": true,
  "scope": "openid offline",
  "client_id": "my_client",
  "sub": "foo@bar.com",
  "aud": [],
  "iss": "http://ory.hydra.example/",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "token_use": "access_token",
  "ext": {
      "foo": "bar"
    }
}
     `}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

## Rejecting token claims update

To gracefully reject token contents update, the hook must return a `403 Forbidden` response. Any other response results in a
failure of the token update and, as a result, failure of the entire token flow.

### Refresh token

If a webhook for `refresh_token` grant type fails with a non-graceful result, the refresh flow will also fail and the supplied
`refresh_token` will remain unused.

## Legacy webhook implementation

There is an old version of the webhook feature built specifically for the `refresh_token` grant type. We recommend using the
generic webhook feature because the old one will soon be deprecated.

Use the Ory CLI with following keys to enable this feature:

```shell title="Enable the refresh token hook"
ory patch oauth2-config {project.id} \
  --add "/oauth2/refresh_token_hook=\"https://my-example.app/token-refresh-hook\"" \
  --format yaml
```

### Webhook payload

The legacy webhook feature works the same way as the new one, but has a different payload that is sent to the webhook URL.

The `refresh_token` hook endpoint must accept the following payload format:

```json
{
  "subject": "foo",
  "client_id": "bar",
  "session": {
    "id_token": {
      "id_token_claims": {
        "jti": "jti",
        "iss": "http://localhost:4444/",
        "sub": "foo",
        "aud": ["bar"],
        "iat": 1234567,
        "exp": 1234567,
        "rat": 1234567,
        "auth_time": 1234567,
        "nonce": "",
        "at_hash": "",
        "acr": "1",
        "amr": [],
        "c_hash": "",
        "ext": {}
      },
      "headers": {
        "extra": {
          "kid": "key-id"
        }
      },
      "username": "username",
      "subject": "foo",
      "expires_at": 1234567
    },
    "extra": {},
    "client_id": "bar",
    "consent_challenge": "",
    "exclude_not_before_claim": false,
    "allowed_top_level_claims": [],
    "kid": "key-id"
  },
  "requester": {
    "client_id": "bar",
    "granted_scopes": ["openid", "offline"],
    "granted_audience": [],
    "grant_types": ["refresh_token"]
  },
  "granted_scopes": ["openid", "offline"],
  "granted_audience": []
}
```

:::note

If you enable both legacy and the new webhook features, both will be executed for the `refresh_token` grant type. The results of
both webhooks will be applied onto the session. In case of conflict, result of the new webhook will take priority.
