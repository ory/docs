This document describes how to configure the token expiration time for various tokens in Ory, including the user login and consent
flow, access tokens, ID tokens, auth codes, and refresh tokens.

## Access token

Access tokens are short-lived tokens that grant access to resources for a limited time. By default, the access token in Ory lasts
for one hour. However, you can configure the access token's expiration time per client or globally by using the Ory CLI.

Use the Ory CLI to configure the access token's lifespan. The following command sets the access token's lifespan to two hours
globally:

```shell
ory patch oauth2-config --project <project-id> --workspace <workspace-id> \
  --replace "/ttl/access_token=\"2h\"" \
  --format yaml
```

## Refresh token

Refresh tokens are long-lived tokens that are used to obtain new access tokens. By default, the refresh token in Ory lasts for 30
days.

:::note

The maximum age of refresh tokens is 6 months. This means that refresh tokens must be rotated at least every 6 months.

:::

Use the Ory CLI to configure the refresh token's lifespan. The following command sets the refresh token's lifespan to one day
globally:

```shell
ory patch oauth2-config --project <project-id> --workspace <workspace-id> \
  --replace "/ttl/refresh_token=\"24h\"" \
  --format yaml
```

## Authorization code

Auth codes are temporary codes that are exchanged for access tokens. By default, the auth code in Ory lasts for ten minutes. For
example, if you want the auth code to last for five minutes, set the config as follows:

```shell
ory patch oauth2-config --project <project-id> --workspace <workspace-id> \
  --replace "/ttl/authorization_code=\"5m\"" \
  --format yaml
```

## ID token

ID tokens are JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) that contain user identity information. By default, the ID token in Ory lasts for one hour.
However, you can modify this value using:

```shell
ory patch oauth2-config --project <project-id> --workspace <workspace-id> \
  --replace "/ttl/id_token=\"5m\"" \
  --format yaml
```

## Login and consent flow

The user login and consent flow in Ory defines how long the user has to submit login credentials and consent. By default, the user
session lasts for 1 hour. However, you can modify this value using the Ory CLI:

```shell
ory patch oauth2-config --project <project-id> --workspace <workspace-id> \
  --replace "/ttl/login_consent_request=\"2h\"" \
  --format yaml
```

### Authentication session

The authentication session in Ory defines how long the user remains authenticated after logging in. By default, the authentication
session lasts for 30 days and the maximum time is 180 days. You can modify this value using the Ory CLI:

```shell
ory patch oauth2-config --project <project-id> --workspace <workspace-id> \
  --replace "/ttl/authentication_session=\"30d\"" \
  --format yaml
```

The authentication session has no impact on any existing access, refresh, or ID tokens. If it is expired, the user will have to
perform the "login flow" again when performing the [OAuth2 Authorization Code Flow](../../oauth2-oidc/authorization-code-flow) or
OpenID Connect Implicit / Hybrid Flow.

Furthermore, [OpenID Connect Back-Channel Logout](../../oauth2-oidc/oidc-logout) won't work if the authentication session is
expired.

## Lifespan configuration for specific clients

In Ory, you can modify the access, ID, and refresh token lifespan for each grant type (`authorization_code`, `implicit`,
`refresh_token`, `client_credentials`, `urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer`) individually per client.

To configure the lifespan for specific clients, use the SDK:

```mdx-code-block
import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock'
import tsExample from '!!raw-loader!../../../code-examples/sdk/typescript/src/oauth2/client-lifespan.ts'

<CodeBlock language="tsx">{tsExample}</CodeBlock>
```
