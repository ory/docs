Installing ORY Hydra on any system is straight forward. We provide pre-built
binaries, Docker Images and support various package managers.

## Docker

```mdx-code-block
import Docker from '@site/src/components/Install/Docker'

<Docker repo="hydra" name="Ory Hydra" />
```

## macOS

```mdx-code-block
import MacOS from '@site/src/components/Install/MacOS'

<MacOS repo="hydra" name="Ory Hydra" />
```

## Linux

```mdx-code-block
import Linux from '@site/src/components/Install/Linux'

<Linux repo="hydra" name="Ory Hydra" />
```

## Windows

```mdx-code-block
import Windows from '@site/src/components/Install/Windows'

<Windows repo="hydra" name="Ory Hydra" />
```

## Kubernetes

Please head over to the [Kubernetes Helm Chart](guides/kubernetes-helm-chart)
documentation.

## Download Binaries

You can download the client and server binaries on our
[Github releases](https://github.com/ory/hydra/releases) page. There is
currently no installer available. You have to add the Hydra binary to the PATH
in your environment yourself, for example by putting it into `/usr/local/bin` or
something comparable.

Once installed, you should be able to run:

```shell
$ hydra help
```

## Building from Source

If you wish to compile ORY Hydra yourself, you need to install and set up
[Go 1.15+](https://golang.org/) and add `$GOPATH/bin` to your `$PATH`.

The following commands will check out the latest release tag of ORY Hydra,
compile it, and set up flags so that `hydra version` works as expected. Please
note that this will only work in a Bash-like shell.

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/ory/hydra.git
$ cd hydra
$ GO111MODULE=on make install-stable
$ $(go env GOPATH)/bin/hydra help
```
