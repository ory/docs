A JSON Web Key (JWK) is a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) data structure that
represents a cryptographic key and is specified at
[IETF RFC7517](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517). If you've heard of PEM
files...

```sh
-----BEGIN ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY-----
id: MIIFDjBABgkqhkiG9w0BBQ0wMzAbBgkqhkiG9w0BBQwwDg
MBQGCCqGSIb3DQMHBAgD1kGN4ZslJgSCBMi1xk9jhlPxPc

GEs=
-----END ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY-----
```

... JWKs are the same, but formatted using JSON:

```json
{
  "keys":
  [
   {"kty":"oct",
    "alg":"A128KW",
    "k":"GawgguFyGrWKav7AX4VKUg"},

   {"kty":"oct",
    "k":"AyM1SysPpbyDfgZld3umj1qzKObwVMkoqQ-EstJQLr_T-1qS0gZH75
  aKtMN3Yj0iPS4hcgUuTwjAzZr1Z9CAow",
    "kid":"HMAC key used in JWS spec Appendix A.1 example"}
  ]
}
```

Ory Hydra offers an API for generating and managing JWKs, the
[JSON Web Keys API](./reference/api.mdx). When using persistent storage
backends, the keys are encrypted at rest using AES256-GCM and _the system
secret_. The system secret is generated by default and overridden by the
environment variable `SECRETS_SYSTEM`.

JWKs are well supported amongst all languages. This endpoint helps you managing
certificates, private, public and symmetric keys. It's important to never
transport keys over insecure channels such as http.

The [REST API Documentation](./reference/api.mdx) will give you details on the
various endpoints.

Ory Hydra doesn't support signing JWTs using symmetric keys. Doing so will make
anyone, having the secret, able to forge the tokens.

## Auto-generated JWKs

Hydra generates a couple of JSON Web Keys in order to operate:

- `http://localhost:4445/keys/hydra.openid.id-token`: A RSA public/private key
  pair for signing and validating OpenID Connect ID Tokens.
- `http://localhost:4445/keys/https-tls`: A RSA public/private key pair and a
  certificate for signing HTTP over TLS.
