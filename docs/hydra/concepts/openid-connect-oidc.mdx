Before you start reading this document, please make sure to have covered all
topics in [OAuth 2.0 Concepts](./oauth2.mdx).

OpenID Connect works like OAuth2. The primary use case for OpenID Connect is to
solve "Login with <Google|Facebook|Hydra>" flows.

To initiate an OpenID Connect flow all you have to do is to add the `openid`
scope to your OAuth2 Authorize Code Flow:

```
https://my-hydra/oauth2/auth?client_id=...&response_type=code&scope=openid
```

:::note

You need to make sure that your OAuth2 Client is allowed to request the `openid`
scope!

:::

Once you exchange the authorize code for the access and refresh token

```
POST /oauth/token HTTP/1.1
Host: my-hydra

grant_type=authorization_code
&code=xxxxxxxxxxx
&redirect_uri=https://example-app.com/redirect
&client_id=xxxxxxxxxx
&client_secret=xxxxxxxxxx
```

you will receive an ID Token:

```json
{
  "access_token": "MTQ0NjJkZmQ5OTM2NDE1ZTZjNGZmZjI3",
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "refresh_token": "IwOGYzYTlmM2YxOTQ5MGE3YmNmMDFkNTVk",
  "id_token": "eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6IjFlOWdkazcifQ.ewogImlzcyI6ICJodHRwOi8vc2VydmVyLmV4YW1wbGUuY29tIiwKICJzdWIiOiAiMjQ4Mjg5NzYxMDAxIiwKICJhdWQiOiAiczZCaGRSa3F0MyIsCiAibm9uY2UiOiAibi0wUzZfV3pBMk1qIiwKICJleHAiOiAxMzExMjgxOTcwLAogImlhdCI6IDEzMTEyODA5NzAKfQ.ggW8hZ1EuVLuxNuuIJKX_V8a_OMXzR0EHR9R6jgdqrOOF4daGU96Sr_P6qJp6IcmD3HP99Obi1PRs-cwh3LO-p146waJ8IhehcwL7F09JdijmBqkvPeB2T9CJNqeGpe-gccMg4vfKjkM8FcGvnzZUN4_KSP0aAp1tOJ1zZwgjxqGByKHiOtX7TpdQyHE5lcMiKPXfEIQILVq0pc_E2DzL7emopWoaoZTF_m0_N0YzFC6g6EJbOEoRoSK5hoDalrcvRYLSrQAZZKflyuVCyixEoV9GfNQC3_osjzw2PAithfubEEBLuVVk4XUVrWOLrLl0nx7RkKU8NXNHq-rvKMzqg",
  "scope": "openid"
}
```

The ID Token's purpose is to authenticate the End-User at the OAuth2 Client
Application. **It doesn't** solve session management or anything else (you still
have to manage cookies, logout, ... yourself!) - it's just a "certificate".

### Userinfo

The `/userinfo` endpoint returns information on a user given an access token.
Since Ory Hydra is agnostic to any end-user data, the `/userinfo` endpoint
returns only minimal information per default:

```
GET https://ory-hydra:4444/userinfo
Authorization: bearer access-token.xxxx

{
 "acr": "oauth2",
 "sub": "xxx@xxx.com"
}
```

Any information set to the key `session.id_token` during accepting the consent
request will also be included here.

```js
// This is node-js pseudo code and won't work if you copy it 1:1

const body = {
    // grant_scope: ["foo", "bar"],
    // ...
    session: {
        id_token: {
            "foo": "bar"
        },
    }
}

fetch('https://hydra/oauth2/auth/requests/consent/' + challenge + '/accept', {
    method: 'PUT',
    body: JSON.stringify(body),
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }
}).
    // then(function (response) {
```

By making the `/userinfo` call with a token issued by this consent request, one
would receive:

```
GET https://ory-hydra:4444/userinfo
Authorization: bearer new-access-token.xxxx

{
 "acr": "oauth2",
 "sub": "xxx@xxx.com",
 "foo": "bar"
}
```

You should only include data that has been authorized by the end-user through an
OAuth 2.0 Scope. If an OAuth 2.0 Client, for example, requests the `phone` scope
and the end-user authorizes that scope, the phone number should be added to
`session.id_token`.

> Be aware that the `/userinfo` endpoint is public. Its contents are thus as
> publicly visible as those of ID Tokens. It's therefore imperative to **not
> expose sensitive information without end-user consent.**
