title: Do You Need OAuth2?
---

OAuth2 and OpenID Connect is all the rage with big platforms (Google, Facebook,
GitHub) and identity SaaS products (Okta, Auth0) which is why you probably ended
up at Ory Hydra. But before you start hacking away, the best use of your time
right now is to re-evaluate if you really need OAuth2 and OpenID Connect.

To do so, we will cover common misunderstandings and misconceptions about OAuth2
in this document and guidance on what to do instead!

reset, social sign in, profile management, 2fa, and more, check out

## What it's Good for

If you are like GitHub and you want to enable people not associated with your
company like CircleCi or TravisCI to have access to your user's data, Ory Hydra
is the right tool for you.

If you want apps and websites you don't own to use your application as a
potential sign in (for example be listed alongside "Sign in with Google", "Sign
in with Apple"), Ory Hydra is the right tool for you.

If you use an API that works with OAuth2 or OpenID Connect, then of course you
need to use that API - but then you are on the OAuth2 / OpenID Connect client
side!

If you want a system for user registration, password recovery, login form,
session management and user settings, then don't start with OAuth2 right away.
It's recommended to use [Ory Kratos](https://www.ory.sh/kratos) for your basic
user management needs and then figure out if you still need OAuth2.

## OAuth2 and OpenID Connect don't Solve Registration, Password Reset, ...

OAuth2 and OpenID Connect are so-called delegation protocols which aren't
concerned with user registration, password recovery, changing a password or
email address and so on.

Actually, OAuth2 and OpenID Connect don't even specify how your users sign in
(email and password? username and password? passwordless? sms 2fa?), they only
establish that **you need a method for users to sign in**.

If you are wondering what password hashing algorithm to use, or how your users
sign up for your platform, then you don't need OAuth2 or OpenID Connect right
now. Instead, you should give [Ory Kratos](https://www.ory.sh/kratos/) a spin,
which aims to solve that.

## Access and Refresh Tokens aren't Sessions!

With OAuth2 and OpenID Connect you end up with three session layers:

- Your **Application's Session Manager** keeps track of the user within your
  application. You will use OpenID Connect to initiate and complete the login,
  but your application needs to store and track and invalidate the session.
- Ory Hydra maintains a session cookie. When a user signs in, the cookie will be
  set for that user. This allows the next OAuth2 request to complete without
  requesting the user to sign in again.
- Optionally - If your application connects to a third-party identity provider
  (such as Sign in with Google, GitHub, Facebook, ...) that third party provider
  also maintains a session of the user.

A common misconception is that access and refresh tokens represent a user
session. **They don't.**

Let's take a look at a common example: CircleCI/TravisCI/... and GitHub. To use
CircleCI or TravisCI or similar products, they usually prompt you to sign into
GitHub because they need access to your repositories. Once access is granted,
CircleCI creates a new user account in their database and generates a session
cookie (see Application Session Manager above). If you now sign out of GitHub,
you will make two observations:

1. CircleCI still has access to your repositories;
2. You are still logged into CircleCI.

If you instead sign out of CircleCI:

1. CircleCI still has access to your repositories;
2. You are still logged into GitHub.

That's because both applications are built by different people and different
companies, and the user behavior on one site doesn't reflect user intent on
another. It would be crazy if some app could just log you out of GitHub, or if
signing out of Google would invalidate your sessions on all the websites where
you used "Sign in with Google".

Access and refresh tokens allow developers you don't know to do things in your
application in the name of your users over a prolonged period of time. CircleCI
uses access tokens to watch your repositories for changes, update status checks
on pull requests, using access and refresh tokens. These tokens are valid for as
long as you don't remove CircleCI from your GitHub account. Logout doesn't
change any of that.

Now you should be at a point where

1. you realize that you only want to solve sign up, login, session management
   and that you don't need OAuth2 - your next step in this case should be to
   check out [Ory Kratos](https://www.ory.sh/kratos/) which does solve all of
   that;
2. you are reaffirmed that you need OAuth2 and OpenID connect because you want
   developers you don't know to interact with your users and your users' data -
   in which case Ory Hydra is a great fit for you!

## "But Google/Facebook/... use OAuth2 and OpenID Connect"

Have you ever wondered why, when signing into Google/Facebook/Twitter/...

- you don't see a screen asking you to grant permission ("Do you want to allow
  ... to access your ...?")?
- their mobile app doesn't open a browser window or use an embedded WebView?
- your browser doesn't perform tons of redirects?

The answer is quite simple - they don't use OAuth2 or OpenID Connect for login
and session management in first-party scenarios. It goes even further than
that - for example YouTube, which runs on a separate domain - doesn't use OAuth2
to sign into your Google account. They use a proprietary flow that includes HTTP
Cookies.

However, OAuth2 and OpenID Connect do get used in certain scenarios at these
companies:

- The Google Cloud SDK CLI uses OAuth2 to sign into your Google Cloud account;
- FireStick uses the OAuth2 Device Authorization grant to log you into your
  Amazon account;
- GitHub does offer an API to third-party developers that involves OAuth2.

## "But SaaS Identity Products use OAuth2 and OpenID Connect"

They do, and they have great SDKs to help you avoid a lot of the OAuth2 and
OpenID Complexity until you hit the very core limitations of OAuth2 which are
amongst others:

- Up to three different session states (see for example
  [Auth0 Session Layers](https://auth0.com/docs/sessions/concepts/session-layers));
- Multi-stage logout flows (see for example
  [Auth0 Logout on NodeJS](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/webapp/nodejs),
  [Revoke Tokens on Auth0](https://auth0.com/docs/tokens/guides/revoke-tokens));
- Logout doesn't invalidate access tokens (see for example
  [Auth0 Logout](https://auth0.com/docs/logout));
- Complex integration with Social Sign In (for example Twitter, Facebook, ...)
  on native mobile apps (see for example
  [iOS Swift - Facebook Login](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/native/ios-swift-facebook-login#before-you-start)).

We picked Auth0 docs a lot because they explain the caveats of using OAuth2 and
OpenID Connect well. These limitations apply to all software (for example Ory
Hydra, Okta, Keycloak, ...) that use OAuth2 and OpenID Connect as their primary
protocols.

## You must Ensure Secure Storage of Access and Refresh Tokens

Storing access and refresh tokens involves tradeoffs:

- Storing tokens in the Browser's `localStorage` or JavaScript cookies is easy,
  but you become highly vulnerable to XSS Attacks;
- Storing tokens in a `httpOnly` cookie is more secure but means that you need a
  server-side component which performs the OAuth2 flows and then stores the
  tokens in an encrypted cookie;
- Storing tokens in a database is secure but implies a lot of overhead.

On top of that, you need to refresh tokens when they expire which may become
very complex in scenarios where you have more than one HTTP request using the
access token. This is mainly true for systems that have refresh tokens which are
valid for one use only (such as Ory Hydra, Auth0, ...).

**Cookies are great** and a common misconception is that cookies are less secure
than tokens or less usable. For 95% of web applications it's enough to work with
cookies, if they only run in the browser and not in a native mobile app. And
that's great, because the browser takes care of:

- Bound to one top-level-domain only;
- Anti-XSS with `httpOnly`
- TLS enforcement with `secure`;
- Smaller CSRF attack surface with the new `SameSite` directive;
- The domain model (cookies are isolated per domain);

[Ory Kratos](https://www.ory.sh/kratos/) works both with tokens and cookies.
Implementing login doesn't involve any manual token handling - just log in and
you're done!

## Access Token Scope isn't an Access Control Permission

The OAuth 2.0 Scope **isn't an internal RBAC/ACL permission**:

- A permission allows an actor to perform a certain action in a system: _Bob is
  allowed to delete his own photos_.
- OAuth 2.0 Scope implies that an end-user granted certain privileges to a
  client: _Bob allowed the OAuth 2.0 Client to delete all users_. But Bob might
  not be allowed to delete all users because Bob isn't an admin.

The OAuth 2.0 Scope can be granted without the end-user actually having the
right permissions. In the examples above, Bob granted an OAuth 2.0 Client the
permission ("scope") to delete all users in his name. However, since Bob isn't
an administrator, that permission ("access control") isn't actually granted to
Bob. Therefore any request by the OAuth 2.0 Client that tries to delete users on
behalf of Bob should fail.
