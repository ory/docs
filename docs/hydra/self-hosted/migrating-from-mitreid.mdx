Please note this page doesn't intend to be a step-by-step guide.

This guide will try to give you some hints on moving your current MITREid instance to Hydra.

# Scopes

Scopes in hydra do not have a relational entity, every client defines its own array of scopes.

# Scope vs Scp

Since Hydra uses `scp` as the scope claim, you have to be sure your client libraries are capable of using both. We had to modify
the behavior of our version of spring.security.oauth2 library following the
[Custom claim](https://dev.to/toojannarong/spring-security-with-jwt-the-easiest-way-2i43) example.

# Query String Parameters

MITREid doesn't mind if the parameters are passed in the body or in the query string. In order to work with Hydra, you have to
migrate all your calls that are using query string parameters to body parameters.

For example, you should move from

```
curl -X POST  http://127.0.0.1/mitreid-server/token?grant_type=client_credentials -H "Authorization: $AUTH" ...
```

to

```
curl -X POST  http://127.0.0.1/mitreid-server/token -H "Authorization: $AUTH" --data-urlencode 'grant_type=client_credentials' ...
```

# Scope Strategies if no scope is requested

The last pitfall found during the migration was the difference of behavior when performing the `client_credentials` grant without
specifying a scope. By default, Ory Hydra returns an empty scope, but MITREid grants the default scope for the OAuth 2.0 Client.

To change the behavior in Ory Hydra, either set environment variable `OAUTH2_CLIENT_CREDENTIALS_DEFAULT_GRANT_SCOPE=true` or
alternatively add to Ory Hydra's configuration file:

```yaml title="path/to/hydra.yaml"
oauth2:
  client_credentials:
    default_grant_allowed_scope: true
```

Once set, Ory Hydra will behave like MITREid and grant the OAuth2 Client's scope when an empty scope is requested for a
`client_credentials` grant.
