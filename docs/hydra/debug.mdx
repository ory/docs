Spec-compliant OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect is hard. Let's take a look how to resolve certain issues.

## First Aid

There are three things you can do to quickly debug any issue:

1. Check the logs. Ory Hydra has extensive logging and you will find the issue most likely in the logs. Here is an example log
   line for a client that requested a redirect URL that didn't match the whitelisted redirect URLS:
   `time="2018-08-07T16:01:16Z" level=error msg="An error occurred" description="The request is missing a required parameter, includes an invalid parameter value, includes a parameter more than once, or is otherwise malformed" error=invalid_request hint="The \"redirect_uri\" parameter doesn't match any of the OAuth 2.0 Client's pre-registered redirect urls."`
2. Check the URL because of two reasons:
   1. Ory Hydra sends `error_hint`, `error`, `error_description`, `error_debug` in the URL. You will find the cause of the error
      most likely in there.
   2. You are maybe in the wrong URL. Make sure the host and port and path is correct. This happens often when you're just
      starting out and experimenting.
3. Set environment variable `OAUTH2_EXPOSE_INTERNAL_ERRORS=true`. Don't do this in production, it's possible, though unlikely,
   that important data leaks with this. If set to true, Ory Hydra will set the `error_debug` query parameter if debug information
   is available.
4. If you're just starting out and experimenting your docker set up doesn't work at all:
   1. Stop all containers
   2. Remove them (unless you have something important running)
   3. Retry. **This can help a lot if you are new to this!**

## OpenID Connect ID Token missing

If you expect an OAuth 2.0 ID Token but aren't receiving one, this can have multiple reasons:

1. You are using the `client_credentials` grant which can't return an ID token.
2. You forgot to request the `openid` scope when calling `/oauth2/auth?response_type=code` (Authorize Code Flow - correct would be
   `/oauth2/auth?response_type=code&scope=openid`) or the `id_token` response type when calling `/oauth2/auth?response_type=token`
   (Implicit/Hybrid flow - correct would be `/oauth2/auth?response_type=token+id_token&scope=openid` or any other combination such
   as `response_type=id_token`, `response_type=token+code+id_token`).
3. You forgot to include `nonce` when calling `/oauth2/auth?response_type=id_token` or any combination of `id_token`
   (`token+id_token`, `token+code+id_token` etc.) `nonce` is a value sent by the client application and included as a claim in the
   returned `id_token`. The `nonce` claim can then be verified by the client application to mitigate any replay attacks. Optional
   for Authoize Code Flow, but mandatory for Implicit/Hybrid flow. Correct request would be -
   `/oauth2/auth?response_type=id_token&nonce=some-value`. You can read more about `nonce` here
   [OpenId Connect Core](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#NonceNotes).
4. Your consent app didn't send `granted_scope: ["openid"]` or when accepting the consent request.
5. The OAuth 2.0 Client making the request isn't allowed to request the scope `openid`.

## OAuth 2.0 Refresh Token is missing

If you expect an OAuth 2.0 Refresh Token but aren't receiving one, this can have multiple reasons:

1. You are using an implicit or hybrid flow. These flows never return a refresh token!
2. You are using the `client_credentials` grant which can't return a refresh token.
3. You forgot to request the `offline` or `offline_access` scope when calling `/oauth2/auth`.
4. You consent app didn't send `granted_scope: ["offline"]` or `granted_scope: ["offline_access"]` when accepting the consent
   request.
5. The OAuth 2.0 Client making the request isn't allowed to grant type `refresh_token`.

## OAuth 2.0 Authorize Code Flow fails

The most likely cause is misconfiguration, summarized in the next sections.

## Refresh Token Flow fails

Refresh tokens can become invalid if abuse is detected, but coding issues may also trigger this scenario, for example if a client
makes multiple requests.

Some common examples:

1.  Replay of authorization code grant.
2.  Replay of refresh token grant.

### Wrong or misconfigured OAuth 2.0 Client

You are using the wrong OAuth 2.0 Client or the OAuth 2.0 Client has a broken configuration. To check that you're using the right
client, run:

```
hydra clients get --endpoint http://ory-hydra <the-client-id>
```

The result shows you the whole client (excluding its secret). Check that the values are correct. Example:

```
{
        "client_id": "my-client",
        "grant_types": [
                "authorization_code"
        ],
        "jwks": {},
        "redirect_uris": [
                "http://127.0.0.1:5556/callback"
        ],
        "response_types": [
                "code"
        ],
        "scope": "openid offline",
        "subject_type": "pairwise",
        "token_endpoint_auth_method": "client_secret_basic",
        "userinfo_signed_response_alg": "none"
}
```

### Redirect URL isn't whitelisted

A likely cause of your request failing is that you are using the wrong redirect URL. Assuming your OAuth 2.0 URL looks like
`http://ory-hydra/oauth2/auth?client_id=my-client&...&redirect_uri=http://my-url/callback`

The redirect URL `http://my-url/callback` must be whitelisted in your client configuration. The URLs **must** match. URL
`http://my-url/callback` and `http://my-url/callback?foo=bar` are different URLs!

To see the whitelisted redirect_uris, check the client:

```
hydra clients get --endpoint http://ory-hydra <the-client-id>

{
        // ...
        "redirect_uris": [
                "http://127.0.0.1:5556/callback"
        ],
        // ...
}
```

Here you see that `http://my-url/callback` isn't in the list, which is why the request fails.

### oauth2/token endpoint fails for jwks based client

When trying to get an access token for a client registered with `"token_endpoint_auth_method": "private_key_jwt"` it's possible
that the provided jwt has expired.

The response body that's sent to the client is like below

```
{
    "error": "error",
    "error_description": "The error is unrecognizable Token is expired"
}
```

The debug error messages isn't provided to avoid divulging more information to a malicious client.

However if you need more information in response (for debugging) , you can enable the following environment variables in hydra
server :

```

OAUTH2_EXPOSE_INTERNAL_ERRORS=true;
OAUTH2_INCLUDE_LEGACY_ERROR_FIELDS=true
```

This configuration are documented [here](https://www.ory.sh/hydra/docs/reference/configuration/).

Now you will be able to see the error_debug field in the response like below :

```
{
    "error": "error",
    "error_description": "The error is unrecognizable",
    "status_code": 500,
    "error_debug": "Token is expired"
}
```
