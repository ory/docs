Spec-compliant OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect is hard. Let's take a look how to resolve certain issues.

## OpenID Connect ID Token missing

If you expect an OAuth 2.0 ID Token but aren't receiving one, this can have multiple reasons:

1. You are using the `client_credentials` grant which can't return an ID token.
2. You forgot to request the `openid` scope when calling `/oauth2/auth?response_type=code` (Authorize Code Flow - correct would be
   `/oauth2/auth?response_type=code&scope=openid`) or the `id_token` response type when calling `/oauth2/auth?response_type=token`
   (Implicit/Hybrid flow - correct would be `/oauth2/auth?response_type=token+id_token&scope=openid` or any other combination such
   as `response_type=id_token`, `response_type=token+code+id_token`).
3. You forgot to include `nonce` when calling `/oauth2/auth?response_type=id_token` or any combination of `id_token`
   (`token+id_token`, `token+code+id_token` etc.) `nonce` is a value sent by the client application and included as a claim in the
   returned `id_token`. The `nonce` claim can then be verified by the client application to mitigate any replay attacks. Optional
   for Authoize Code Flow, but mandatory for Implicit/Hybrid flow. Correct request would be -
   `/oauth2/auth?response_type=id_token&nonce=some-value`. You can read more about `nonce` here
   [OpenId Connect Core](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#NonceNotes).
4. Your consent app didn't send `granted_scope: ["openid"]` or when accepting the consent request.
5. The OAuth 2.0 Client making the request isn't allowed to request the scope `openid`.

## OAuth 2.0 Refresh Token is missing

If you expect an OAuth 2.0 Refresh Token but aren't receiving one, this can have multiple reasons:

1. You are using an implicit or hybrid flow. These flows never return a refresh token!
2. You are using the `client_credentials` grant which can't return a refresh token.
3. You forgot to request the `offline` or `offline_access` scope when calling `/oauth2/auth`.
4. You consent app didn't send `granted_scope: ["offline"]` or `granted_scope: ["offline_access"]` when accepting the consent
   request.
5. The OAuth 2.0 Client making the request isn't allowed to grant type `refresh_token`.

## OAuth 2.0 authorize code flow fails

The most likely cause is misconfiguration, summarized in the next sections.

## Refresh Token flow fails

Refresh tokens can become invalid if abuse is detected, but coding issues may also trigger this scenario, for example if a client
makes multiple requests.

Some common examples:

1.  Replay of authorization code grant.
2.  Replay of refresh token grant.

### Wrong or misconfigured OAuth 2.0 client

You are using the wrong OAuth 2.0 Client or the OAuth 2.0 Client has a broken configuration. To check that you're using the right
client, run:

```
ory get oauth2-client {client.id}}
```

The result shows you the whole client (excluding its secret). Check that the values are correct. Example:

```
{
  "client_id": "my-client",
  "grant_types": [
    "authorization_code"
  ],
  "jwks": {},
  "redirect_uris": [
    "http://127.0.0.1:5556/callback"
  ],
  "response_types": [
    "code"
  ],
  "scope": "openid offline",
  "subject_type": "pairwise",
  "token_endpoint_auth_method": "client_secret_basic",
  "userinfo_signed_response_alg": "none"
}
```

### Redirect URL isn't whitelisted

A likely cause of your request failing is that you are using the wrong redirect URL. Assuming your OAuth 2.0 URL looks like
`https://$PROJECT_SLUG.projects.oryapis.com/oauth2/auth?client_id=my-client&...&redirect_uri=http://my-url/callback`

The redirect URL `http://my-url/callback` must be whitelisted in your client configuration. The URLs **must** match. URL
`http://my-url/callback` and `http://my-url/callback?foo=bar` are different URLs!

To see the whitelisted redirect_uris, check the client:

```shell
ory get oauth2-client {client.id}

{
  // ...
  "redirect_uris": [
    "http://127.0.0.1:5556/callback"
  ],
  // ...
}
```

Here you see that `http://my-url/callback` isn't in the list, which is why the request fails.

### `/oauth2/token` endpoint fails for JWKS based client

When trying to get an access token for a client registered with `"token_endpoint_auth_method": "private_key_jwt"` it's possible
that the provided jwt has expired.

The response body that's sent to the client is like below

```
{
  "error": "error",
  "error_description": "The error is unrecognizable: Token is expired"
}
```

The debug error messages isn't provided to avoid divulging more information to a malicious client.

If you need more information in response for debugging, switch the project to development mode. Now you will be able to see the
`error_debug` field in the response like below:

```
{
  "error": "error",
  "error_description": "The error is unrecognizable",
  "status_code": 500,
  "error_debug": "Token is expired"
}
```
