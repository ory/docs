The Ory Hydra SDK allows for integration with a self-hosted [Ory Hydra OAuth2 Server](https://github.com/ory/hydra).

Before using the SDK, consult the Ory Hydra [REST](../reference/api.mdx) API documentationâ€².

To view the source code for the generated SDKs, visit the
[Ory Hydra SDKs GitHub repository](https://github.com/ory/sdk/tree/master/clients/hydra/). Ory SDKs are generated using the
[openapi-generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator).

## Handling OAuth2 flows

The Ory Hydra SDK doesn't provide a comprehensive API for handling OAuth 2.0 flows such as the authorization code flow and refresh
flow. Use one of the many [well-established libraries](https://oauth.net/code/) for this purpose, don't write your own code to
interact with OAuth 2.0.

Read the [OAuth2 client libraries](../guides/using-oauth2.mdx) document for more information.

### SDK backward compatibility

The Ory SDK uses automated code generation by [`openapi-generator`](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator).
`openapi-generator` can make changes to the generated code with each new version, which breaks backwards compatibility in some
cases. As a result, Ory SDK may not be compatible with previous versions.
