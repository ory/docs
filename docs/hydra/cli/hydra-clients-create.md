Create a new OAuth 2.0 Client

### Synopsis

This command creates an OAuth 2.0 Client which can be used to perform various OAuth 2.0 Flows like the Authorize Code, Implicit,
Refresh flow.

Ory Hydra implements the OpenID Connect Dynamic Client registration specification. Most flags are supported by this command as
well.

Example: hydra clients create -n &#34;my app&#34; -c http://localhost/cb -g authorization_code -r code -a core,foobar

To encrypt auto generated client secret, use &#34;--pgp-key&#34;, &#34;--pgp-key-url&#34; or &#34;--keybase&#34; flag, for
example: hydra clients create -n &#34;my app&#34; -g client_credentials -r token -a core,foobar --keybase keybase_username

```
