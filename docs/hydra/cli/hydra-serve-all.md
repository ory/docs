## hydra serve all

Serves both public and administrative HTTP/2 APIs

### Synopsis

Starts a process which listens on two ports for public and administrative HTTP/2 API requests.

If you want more granular control (e.g. different TLS settings) over each API group (administrative, public) you
can run "serve admin" and "serve public" separately.

This command exposes a variety of controls via environment variables. You can
set environments using "export KEY=VALUE" (Linux/macOS) or "set KEY=VALUE" (Windows). On Linux,
you can also set environments by prepending key value pairs: "KEY=VALUE KEY2=VALUE2 hydra"

All possible controls are listed below. This command exposes exposes command line flags, which are listed below
the controls section.

## Configuration

Ory Hydra can be configured using environment variables as well as a configuration file. For more information
