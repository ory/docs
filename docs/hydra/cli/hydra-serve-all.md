## hydra serve all

Serves both public and administrative HTTP/2 APIs

### Synopsis

Starts a process which listens on two ports for public and administrative HTTP/2
API requests.

If you want more granular control (e.g. different TLS settings) over each API
group (administrative, public) you can run &#34;serve admin&#34; and &#34;serve
public&#34; separately.

This command exposes a variety of controls via environment variables. You can
set environments using &#34;export KEY=VALUE&#34; (Linux/macOS) or &#34;set
KEY=VALUE&#34; (Windows). On Linux, you can also set environments by prepending
key value pairs: &#34;KEY=VALUE KEY2=VALUE2 hydra&#34;

All possible controls are listed below. This command exposes exposes command
line flags, which are listed below the controls section.

## Configuration

Ory Hydra can be configured using environment variables as well as a
configuration file. For more information on configuration options, open the
configuration documentation:
