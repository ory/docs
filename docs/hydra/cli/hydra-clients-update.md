## hydra clients update

Update an entire OAuth 2.0 Client

### Synopsis

This command replaces an OAuth 2.0 Client by its ID.

Please be aware that this command replaces the entire client. To update only the name, a full client should be provided, for
example: hydra clients update client-1 -n &#34;my updated app&#34; -c http://localhost/cb -g authorization_code -r code -a
core,foobar

If only the name flag (-n &#34;my updated app&#34;) is provided, the all other fields are updated to their default values.

To encrypt auto generated client secret, use &#34;--pgp-key&#34;, &#34;--pgp-key-url&#34; or &#34;--keybase&#34; flag, for
example: hydra clients update client-1 -n &#34;my updated app&#34; -g client_credentials -r token -a core,foobar --keybase
keybase_username

```
hydra clients update <id> [flags]
