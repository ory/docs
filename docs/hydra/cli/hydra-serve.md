## hydra serve

Parent command for starting public and administrative HTTP/2 APIs

### Synopsis

Ory Hydra exposes two ports, a public and an administrative port. The public
port is responsible for handling requests from the public internet, such as the
OAuth 2.0 Authorize and Token URLs. The administrative port handles
administrative requests like creating OAuth 2.0 Clients, managing JSON Web Keys,
and managing User Login and Consent sessions.

It is recommended to run &#34;hydra serve all&#34;. If you need granular control
over CORS settings or similar, you may want to run &#34;hydra serve admin&#34;
and &#34;hydra serve public&#34; separately.

To learn more about each individual command, run:

- hydra help serve all
- hydra help serve admin
- hydra help serve public

All sub-commands share command line flags and configuration options.

## Configuration

Ory Hydra can be configured using environment variables as well as a
configuration file. For more information on configuration options, open the
configuration documentation:
