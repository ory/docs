## hydra token user

An exemplary OAuth 2.0 Client performing the OAuth 2.0 Authorize Code Flow

### Synopsis

Starts an exemplary web server that acts as an OAuth 2.0 Client performing the
Authorize Code Flow. This command will help you to see if Ory Hydra has been
configured properly.

This command must not be used for anything else than manual testing or demo
purposes. The server will terminate on error and success, unless if the
--no-shutdown flag is provided.

```
hydra token user [flags]
```

### Options

```
      --audience strings       Request a specific OAuth 2.0 Access Token Audience
      --auth-url endpoint      Usually it is enough to specify the endpoint flag, but if you want to force the authorization url, use this flag
      --client-id string       Use the provided OAuth 2.0 Client ID, defaults to environment variable OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID
      --client-secret string   Use the provided OAuth 2.0 Client Secret, defaults to environment variable OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET
      --endpoint string        Set the URL where Ory Hydra is hosted, defaults to environment variable HYDRA_URL
  -h, --help                   help for user
      --https                  Sets up HTTPS for the endpoint using a self-signed certificate which is re-generated every time you start this command
      --max-age int            Set the OpenID Connect max_age parameter
      --no-open                Do not open the browser window automatically
      --no-shutdown            Do not terminate on success/error. State and nonce will be regenerated when auth flow has completed (either due to an error or success).

      --scope strings          Request OAuth2 scope (default [offline,openid])
      --token-url endpoint     Usually it is enough to specify the endpoint flag, but if you want to force the token url, use this flag
```
