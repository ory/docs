id: logout
title: Logout not Working as Expected
---

Sometimes, calling `/oauth2/sessions/logout` doesn't behave as expected, for example:

- An error occurs.
- You are being redirected directly to the post_logout_redirect_uri instead of the logout UI.

First of all, there are two types of logout requests - one is called "OP (OpenID Provider) Initiated" and one "RP (Relying Party)
Initiated". The first flow MUST NEITHER contain the `id_token_hint`, nor a `state`, nor `post_logout_redirect_uri`.

If no active authentication session is set at Ory Hydra, the browser will be redirected immediately to the system-wide configured
post logout redirect URI.

An active session may be missing because:

- You are mixing up domain names (for example `127.0.0.1` and `localhost` - **this is a common mistake**)
- You are running Ory Hydra behind a proxy that messes with Cookies
- You are using a Browser with a very strict privacy policy which makes it difficult or impossible for Ory Hydra to properly set
  cookies. We've observed that the **Brave Browser** is very, very difficult here.
- You didn't set `remember: true` when accepting the login request

**Before filing a bug report, make sure you actually have a cookie named `oauth2_authentication_session` for the URL Ory Hydra is
running on, and for the domain that's in your `http://.../oauth2/sessions/logout`**

If `id_token_hint` is set, you may define both `state` and `post_logout_redirect_uri`. The same problems can cause this flow to
behave unexpectedly as listed above, with the only difference that now Ory Hydra knows who the user to be logged out is (from the
`id_token_hint`) and if any Front-/Back-channel Logout is configured for that client, it will be executed even if there is no
valid authentication session for that user in Ory Hydra.
