The Ory Account Experience is the default user interface for all self-service screens like login, registration, or consent. It can
be accessed under `https://your-slug.projects.oryapis.com/ui`. New Ory Network projects are automatically configured to use the
Account Experience. You can find various customizations and settings in the Ory Console under `Account Experience`.

## Theming

The Account Experience can be themed using the Ory Console. Head over to the
[theming settings](https://console.ory.sh/projects/current/account-experience/theming). It is also possible to set a custom logo
and favicon.

## Welcome Screen

The Account Experience comes with a welcome screen that shows information about the current user's session. As this screen is
rather meant for debugging purposes, it can be disabled in the [Ory Console](https://console.ory.sh/projects/current/ui).

## Translations (i18n) & Message Customization

Currently, the account experience is available in English, Spanish, German, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Polish, Finnish, Dutch,
Swedish, and more. For a full list of available languages please have a look at
[the source](https://github.com/ory/elements/tree/main/src/locales). If you want to add a new language or fix some wording, please
open a pull request in [ory/elements](https://github.com/ory/elements#internalization-i18n). To determine the language to use, the
Account Experience uses the `Accept-Language` header. If the language is not available, the fallback language (English) is used.
Custom translations are not supported at the moment, but please reach out if you need this feature.

## Custom Domains

The Account Experience is also available under custom domains the same way it works on the slug URL.
