The Ory Account Experience is the default user interface for all self-service screens like login, registration, or consent. It can
be accessed under `https://your-slug.projects.oryapis.com/login`. New Ory Network projects are automatically configured to use the
Account Experience. You can find various customizations and settings in the Ory Console under `Account Experience`.

## Theming

The Account Experience can be themed using the Ory Console. Head over to the
[theming settings](https://console.ory.sh/projects/current/account-experience/theming). It is also possible to set a custom logo
and favicon.

## Translations (i18n) & Message Customization

Currently, the account experience is available in 83 languages. For a full list of available languages please have a look at
[the source](https://github.com/ory/elements/tree/main/packages/elements-react/src/locales). If you want to add a new language or
fix some wording, please open a pull request in [ory/elements](https://github.com/ory/elements#internalization-i18n).

By default, the Account Experience automatically adapts to the user's language preferences, and offers translations for all
supported languages. Each language can be enabled or disabled in the Ory Console
under&nbsp;<ConsoleLink route="project.accountExperience.locales" />.

To determine the language to use, the Account Experience uses the `Accept-Language` header. If the language is not available, the
Default Language (English) is used. To change the default language, go
to&nbsp;<ConsoleLink route="project.accountExperience.locales" /> and select your preferred default language.

To turn off automatic language detection, disable **Respect the user's system language preferences** in the Ory Console
under&nbsp;<ConsoleLink route="project.accountExperience.locales" />.

### Custom locales

You can customize any of the existing translations or add your own translations in the Ory Console
under&nbsp;<ConsoleLink route="project.accountExperience.locales" />. Click on the edit icon for the language you want to
customize, and then modify the messages as needed. Custom translations will override the default translations provided by Ory
Elements.
