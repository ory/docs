## Overview

Ory Elements is a component library that allows you to build custom user interfaces for Ory self-service flows. It provides a set
of pre-built components that can be easily integrated into your application, enabling you to create a seamless user experience
while leveraging Ory's powerful authentication and identity management capabilities.

The following diagram illustrates how Ory Elements fits into the Ory ecosystem and your application architecture:

It is designed to work with Ory's self-service flows, such as login, registration, settings, verification, and recovery and the
OAuth2 consent flow. It will automatically adjust to the configured identity schema and configuration of your Ory deployment,
ensuring that your UI is always in sync with the backend. Ory Elements provides a consistent and user-friendly experience across
all self-service flows, making it easier for users to interact with your application.

While it's default experience is a great starting point, Ory Elements allows you to customize the look and feel of your UI to
match your brand and user experience requirements. You can use Ory Elements to build a custom UI that fits your application's
design and user experience, while still leveraging Ory's powerful authentication and identity management capabilities.
