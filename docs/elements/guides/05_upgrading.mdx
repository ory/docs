# Ory Elements 1.1.0 to 1.2.0 upgrade guide

This guide will show you how to migrate from Ory Elements 1.1.0 to 1.2.0.

If you are current overriding components using the `components` prop, you may need to update your overrides to pass the correct
props to your custom components.

- `Node.Button`: Now receives additional props:
  - `isSubmitting`: This prop indicates whether this button was used to submit the form and the form is currently submitting.
  - `buttonProps`: This prop contains all other button-related props that should be spread onto the button element.
- `Node.Input`: Now receives additional props:
  - `inputProps`: This prop contains all other input-related props that should be spread onto the input element.
- `Node.Checkbox`:
  - `inputProps`: This prop contains all other checkbox-related props that should be spread onto the checkbox input element.
- `Node.ConsentScopeCheckbox`:
  - `inputProps`: This prop contains all other checkbox-related props that should be spread onto the checkbox input element.
- `Node.Label`:
  - `fieldError`: This prop contains the error message associated with the field, if any.
- Settings Pages:
  - Each settings section now similarly receives the nodes with a `buttonProps` or `inputProps` prop, depending on the type of
    node.

## Fixes

- If you were using the `RecoveryCodesSettings` component, there was a typo in the prop name for regenerating codes. The correct
  prop name is now `regenerateButton` instead of `regnerateButton`.

# Ory Elements 0.x to 1.x Upgrade Guide

This guide will show you how to migrate from Ory Elements 0.x to 1.x.

Ory Elements 1.0 is a complete rewrite of the Ory Elements 0.x library. It is not backwards compatible with 0.x.

## Migration from Ory Elements 0.x to 1.x

### Update the package name

```bash
npm install @ory/elements-react
```

And change the import path to the new package name.

### `<UserAuthCard />`

Instead of exporting a single UserAuthCard component, the 1.0 version exports a set of components for each flow.

- In most cases, you can simply replace `<UserAuthCard />` with `<Login />`, `<Registration />`, `<Recovery />`, `<Settings />`,
  or `<Verification />` depending on the flow you are using.
- Remove the `additionalProps` prop from the components and pass in the configuration object as a prop to each component. You can
  read more about the configuration in the [configuration guide](./04_configuration.mdx).
- You no longer need to handle the onSubmit event of the components. The components now handle the form submission automatically
  based on the configuration object.
- `includeScripts` is no longer supported. You can remove it from props.
- `cardImage` is no longer supported. You can remove it from props. Use the `logo_light_url` property in the configuration object
  to set the logo.
- `className` is no longer supported. You can remove it from props. Read the [theming guide](./02_theming.mdx) to learn how to
  customize the look and feel of the components.
- `title` is no longer supported. You can remove it from props. Read the [configuration guide](./04_configuration.mdx) to learn
  how to set the title in the card header.
- `subtitle` is no longer supported. Instead, the card's subtitle will be determined dynamically based on the flow's state.

  to set the logo.

- `requested_scope` will be inferred from the `consentChallenge` prop. You can remove it.
- `client` will be inferred from the `consentChallenge` prop. You can remove it.
