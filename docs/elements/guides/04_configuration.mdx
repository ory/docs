Ory Elements exposes a few configuration options that can be used to configure the default behavior of the UI components. These
options can be set globally or per component. This guide will cover the global configuration options available in Ory Elements.

## Project configuration

The `project` configuration is used to configure the overall behavior of the Ory Elements UI components. It includes settings such
as the default locale, redirect URLs, and UI URLs for various actions like login, registration, and recovery.

You can set the project configuration globally in your application, and it will be used by all Ory Elements components. This
allows you to use the default UI but still configure certain behaviors and URLs to match your application's requirements.

Define the project configuration in your application like this:

```ts title="projectConfig.ts"
import { AccountExperienceConfiguration } from "@ory/elements-react"

const projectConfig: AccountExperienceConfiguration = {
  default_locale: "en", // default locale for the UI
  default_redirect_url: "https://example.com/dashboard", // URL to redirect after successful login or registration
  error_ui_url: "https://example.com/error", // URL to handle errors
  login_ui_url: "https://example.com/login", // URL to the login page
  registration_ui_url: "https://example.com/register", // URL to the registration page
  recovery_ui_url: "https://example.com/recovery", // URL to the recovery page
  settings_ui_url: "https://example.com/settings", // URL to the settings page
  verification_ui_url: "https://example.com/verify", // URL to the verification page
  name: "My Project", // the name of your project, used in the UI
  logo_light_url: "https://example.com/logo-light.png", // URL to the light theme logo
  recovery_enabled: true, // controls whether the "Forgot Password" button is shown
  registration_enabled: true, // controls whether the "Register" button in the footer is shown
  verification_enabled: true,

  locale_behavior: "respect_accept_language", // currently unused
}
```

After defining the configuration, you can pass it to the `<Login />`, `<Registration />`, `<Recovery />`, `<Settings />`, and
`<Verification />` components as a prop:

```tsx title="App.tsx"
import { Login } from "@ory/elements-react/theme"
import { OryProvider } from "@ory/elements-react"

import { projectConfig } from "./projectConfig" // import your project configuration

function App() {
  const flow = // fetch or create a flow object for login, registration, etc.
  return <Login flow={flow} config={{ project: projectConfig }} />
}
```

If you're building your own components, you can pass it to the `OryProvider` to make it available to all Ory Elements components:

```tsx title="App.tsx"
import { OryProvider } from "@ory/elements-react"
import { projectConfig } from "./projectConfig" // import your project configuration

function App() {
  return <OryProvider project={{ project: projectConfig }}>{/* Your application components */}</OryProvider>
}
```

### UI URLs

To set the URLs for various UI components, you can use the following properties in the `AccountExperienceConfiguration`:

```typescript title="projectConfig.ts"
const projectConfig: AccountExperienceConfiguration = {
  login_ui_url: "https://example.com/login",
  registration_ui_url: "https://example.com/register",
  recovery_ui_url: "https://example.com/recovery",
  settings_ui_url: "https://example.com/settings",
  verification_ui_url: "https://example.com/verify",
  // ....
}
```

These will be used when the respective actions are triggered, such as when a user needs to log in, register, or recover their
account and should match the URLs of your application's UI. You can also set the `error_ui_url` to handle errors in a custom way:

```typescript title="projectConfig.ts"
const projectConfig: AccountExperienceConfiguration = {
  error_ui_url: "https://example.com/error",
  // ....
}
```

### Logos

To set the logos for the light theme, you can use the following properties:

```typescript title="projectConfig.ts"
const projectConfig: AccountExperienceConfiguration = {
  logo_light_url: "https://example.com/logo-light.png",
  // ....
}
```

### Locale (i18n)

To set a default locale:

```typescript title="projectConfig.ts"
const projectConfig: AccountExperienceConfiguration = {
  default_locale: "en",
  // ....
}
```

For more advanced localization options, such as providing custom translations, refer to the
[Internationalization guide](./03_internationalization.mdx).

## SDK configuration

The `sdk` configuration is used to configure the Ory SDK client that is used by Ory Elements. This includes settings such as the
base URL for the Ory API. You can set the SDK configuration globally in your application, and it will be used by all Ory Elements
components. You can define the SDK configuration like this:

```ts title="sdkConfig.ts"
import { OryClientConfiguration } from "@ory/elements-react"
export const sdkConfig: OryClientConfiguration = {
  sdk: {
    baseUrl: "https://api.example.com", // base URL for the Ory API
    options: {
      headers: {
        "X-Custom-Header": "value", // custom headers for the SDK requests
      },
      middlewares: [], // custom middlewares for the SDK requests
      // other options for the SDK requests
    },
  },
}
```

:::note

If you're running against a standard Ory Network project you don't need to add any special headers or middlewares. Set the
`baseUrl` to your project's URL as listed on <ConsoleLink route="project.settings" /> under **API&nbsp;endpoints**.

:::

Typically, this URL is the same as the one you use to access your Ory services, such as Ory Kratos or Ory Hydra. It is important
to ensure that the base URL is correctly set to match your Ory deployment.

After defining the SDK configuration, you can pass it to the `<OryProvider>` component:

```tsx title="App.tsx"
import { OryProvider } from "@ory/elements-react"
import { sdkConfig } from "./sdkConfig" // import your SDK configuration
import { projectConfig } from "./projectConfig" // import your project configuration

function App() {
  return <OryProvider config={{ project: projectConfig, sdk: sdkConfig }}>{/* Your application components */}</OryProvider>
}
```

### Base URL

If the `baseUrl` property in the `sdk` configuration is unset, the base URL can be set via the environment variable `ORY_SDK_URL`.

In development environments, if neither is set, Ory Elements tries to "guess" the base URL by looking at the current origin of the
page.

For code that is executed in the server side rendering part of the application, the base URL is set to the value of the
`__NEXT_PRIVATE_ORIGIN` or `VERCEL_URL` environment variable (for Vercel preview environments), if available. If neither is found,
an error is thrown.

For code that is run in the browser, the base URL is set to the current origin of the page (via `window.location.origin`), which
is typically the URL of your application. Make sure to use the
[Ory middleware](../reference/@ory/nextjs/middleware/functions/createOryMiddleware.md), so that Ory's self-service API endpoints
are available at the correct paths, such as `/self-service/login`, `/self-service/registration`, etc. on the same origin as your
application. This is the default behavior when using Ory Elements in a Next.js application with the Ory middleware.

:::caution

In production environments it is required to explicitly set the `baseUrl` or `ORY_SDK_URL` environment variable to ensure that the
Ory SDK client communicates with the correct Ory services.
