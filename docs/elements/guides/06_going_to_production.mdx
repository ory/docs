Ory Elements is designed to be used in production environments. However, there are a few things you should consider when going to
production.

## Base URL

Make sure to set the `baseURL` to the correct value. This is the base URL of your Ory Elements instance.

```ts title="projectConfig.ts"
const projectConfig: OryElementsConfiguration = {
  sdk: {
    baseURL: "https://$PROJECT_SLUG.projects.oryapis.com", // Or your custom domain
  },
}
```

Setting this value is important because it ensures that the Ory Elements SDK is able to communicate with the correct Ory API
instance.

In contrast to development environments, Ory Elements and the Ory APIs should be hosted on the same second level domain to make
sure that the cookies set by the Ory APIs are accessible by the Ory Elements SDK.

Read more about the `baseURL` in the [Configuration](./04_configuration.mdx#base-url) guide.
