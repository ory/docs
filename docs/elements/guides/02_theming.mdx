Ory Elements allows you to customize the look and feel of the default UI components by using a custom theme. This guide will show
you how to create and apply a custom theme to your Ory Elements components.

## Understanding CSS theming in Ory Elements

Ory Elements uses CSS variables to define the styles of its components. These variables are defined in a hierarchical manner,
allowing you to override base variables that are used in many components at once or variables that are only used in specifc
components.

To understand this hierarchical structure, consider the following diagram:

```mdx-code-block
import Mermaid from "@site/src/theme/Mermaid"

<Mermaid
  chart={`graph LR
  ui-50 --> interface-background-default-primary-hover
  ui-50 --> interface-background-default-secondary

  interface-background-default-primary-hover --> button-secondary-background-hover
  interface-background-default-primary-hover --> button-social-background-hover
  interface-background-default-primary-hover --> input-background-hover

  interface-background-default-secondary --> checkbox-background-default
  interface-background-default-secondary --> radio-background-default
  interface-background-default-secondary --> toggle-background-default
`}
/>
```

This diagram shows how the `ui-50` variable is used as a base for other variables like
`interface-background-default-primary-hover` and `interface-background-default-secondary`. These variables are then used in
specific components like buttons, checkboxes, and toggles. By overriding the `ui-50` variable, you can change the look and feel of
all components that use it.

## Creating a custom theme

Now, if you want to change the color in all of these components, you can simply override the `ui-50` variable in your CSS files.
This will affect all components that use this variable, allowing you to create a consistent look and feel across your application.

A mix is also possible, where you can override the core variables, and then target specific components with additional styles. For
example, you can override the `ui-50` variable and then add specific styles for buttons:

```css title="theme.css"
:root {
  --ui-50: #f0f4f8; /* Change the base color */
  --button-secondary-background-hover: #e0e4e8; /* Change the button hover color */
}
```

For a full list of CSS variables used in Ory Elements, you can refer to the [CSS Reference](../css-reference) document.

## Applying the custom theme

To apply the custom theme to your Ory Elements components, you need to import the CSS file in your application. You can do this in
your main application file or in a specific component where you want to use the custom theme. Here is an example of how to import
the CSS file in a Next.js application:

```javascript title="pages/_app.js"
import "../styles/theme.css" // Import the custom theme CSS file

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return <Component {...pageProps} />
}
export default MyApp
```
