Ory Elements allows you to customize the look and feel of the default UI components by using a custom theme. This guide will show
you how to create and apply a custom theme to your Ory Elements components.

## Creating a Custom Theme

Theming in Ory Elements is done using CSS variables. You can define your own CSS variables in a separate CSS file or inline in
your application. Here is an example of how to create a custom theme:

```css title="theme.css"
:root {
}
```

## Layering

The variables are set up in a layered manner, meaning that you can override a few core variable and affect the entire look and
feel of the UI. For example, you can set the primary color and the font family like this:

```css title="theme.css"
:root {
}
```

## Applying the Custom Theme

To apply the custom theme to your Ory Elements components, you need to import the CSS file in your application. You can do this in
your main application file or in a specific component where you want to use the custom theme. Here is an example of how to import
the CSS file in a Next.js application:

```javascript title="pages/_app.js"
import "../styles/theme.css" // Import the custom theme CSS file

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return <Component {...pageProps} />
}
export default MyApp
```
