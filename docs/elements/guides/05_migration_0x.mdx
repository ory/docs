This guide will show you how to migrate from Ory Elements 0.x to 1.x.

Ory Elements 1.0 is a complete rewrite of the Ory Elements 0.x library. It is not backwards compatible with 0.x.

## Migration from Ory Elements 0.x to 1.x

### Update the package name

```bash
npm install @ory/elements-react
```

And change the import path to the new package name.

### `<UserAuthCard />`

Instead of exporting a single UserAuthCard component, the 1.0 version exports a set of components for each flow.

- In most cases, you can simply replace `<UserAuthCard />` with `<Login />`, `<Registration />`, `<Recovery />`, `<Settings />`,
  or `<Verification />` depending on the flow you are using.
- Remove the `additionalProps` prop from the components and pass in the configuration object as a prop to each component. You can
  read more about the configuration in the [configuration guide](./04_configuration.mdx).
- You no longer need to handle the onSubmit event of the components. The components now handle the form submission automatically
  based on the configuration object.
- `includeScripts` is no longer supported. You can remove it from props.
