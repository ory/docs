This tutorial will guide you through the process of migrating your existing authentication system to Ory Identities, creating Ory
Network projects, setting up identity schemas, and customizing the user interface to match your current interface.

:::note

This guide serves as an initial reference and may not cover all aspects of your specific use case. If you have any questions or
need further assistance, please contact Ory Support for help.

## Get user data

Export your user data from your from your existing authentication solution or database and find out the hashing algorithm used by
your existing authentication system. If your passwords are not hashed, you can bypass this step, as Ory will handle password
hashing automatically during the import process. Ory supports a range of hashing algorithms; if your current algorithm is
supported, you can use the import API to migrate your users. If the hashing algorithm is not supported or if you can't get the
hashed passwords from your current authentication system, you can use the password migration hook to migrate your existing users.
You can find more details about this process [here](../kratos/manage-identities/25_import-user-accounts-identities.mdx).

## Create Ory Network Projects

You can create a new Ory Network project using the Ory CLI. The command ory create project allows you to specify the environment
of the project, the output format, the name of the project, and the workspace to use. More details about creating a project can be
found [here](../cli/ory-create-project).

## Map user traits

To match identities from your current system with the new Ory system, you can customize the identity schema in Ory to meet your
specific requirements. This schema defines the types of data that the system can store for users, including names, email
addresses, phone numbers, and other authentication-related information. Additionally, you can specify extra metadata fields to be
included in user profiles. Ory offers default presets to assist you in creating and managing identity schemas. More details about
identity schemas can be found [here](../kratos/manage-identities/identity-schema).

## Migrate User Interface

If you're migrating from an existing authentication system, you can start with the built-in
[Account Experience](../account-experience/index.mdx), which offers a standard interface with basic branding to get you up and
running quickly. Alternatively, if you prefer a custom user interface that matches your current design, Ory allows you to create
and style a custom UI that integrates seamlessly with your existing setup. Ory Elements is a component library designed to make
building login, registration, and account pages for Ory straightforward. It is modular and customizable, which means that you can
use only the views you need and style them to match your implementation's design. The UI created with Ory Elements changes
dynamically to adapt to your Ory Network configuration. More details about customizing the user interface can be found
[here](../kratos/bring-your-own-ui/custom-ui-ory-elements).

## Bulk import users

To bulk import identities into Ory, you can use the Identity Import API. A maximum of 2000 identities can be created in a single
request. If you need to import more identities, you need to split the import into multiple requests. The endpoint accepts a JSON
array of identities, each of which must have a create property that holds the identity that should be created. Read more about
this process [here](../kratos/manage-identities/import-user-accounts-identities#bulk-import-identities-from-other-providers).
