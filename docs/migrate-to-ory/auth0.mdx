This guide shows you how to migrate user accounts from Auth0 to Ory. The instructions in this document assume that your Auth0
setup includes a database connection and that the users whose accounts you migrate use emails and passwords as their login
credentials.

If your setup is different, you can use this document as a starting point in defining your own migration procedure.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- Auth0 account with admin access to export user data
- Ory account with an Ory project already created - See [creating a project](docs/migrate-to-ory/migrate/create-project.mdx) for
  instructions
- Required tools:
  - [jq](https://jqlang.org/) - Command-line JSON processor
  - [Gzip](https://www.gnu.org/software/gzip/) - Compression utility
  - [Ory CLI](../guides/cli/01_installation.mdx) - Ory command-line interface
- Time estimate: 1-2 hours depending on the number of users

## Overview

The migration process consists of three phases:

1. [Prepare your Auth0 data](#prepare-your-auth0-data): Export user data and password hashes
2. [Configure your Ory project](#configure-your-ory-project): Set up identity schema for email authentication
3. [Import users to Ory](#import-users-to-ory): Run the migration import script to create users in Ory

## Prepare your Auth0 data

### Create bulk user export

To create a [bulk user export](https://auth0.com/docs/manage-users/user-migration/bulk-user-exports), you need the Management API
Access Token and the ID of your connection. You will need this information to export the Auth0 user data, when you run the
migration export script.

#### Get API access token and connection ID

Follow these steps to get the Management API Access Token and connection ID:

1. Go to your [Auth0 dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/#) and navigate to **Applications** → **APIs**.
2. Select **Auth0 Management API** and go to the **API Explorer** tab. Copy the displayed token.

   :::warning Token expiration

   The token is valid for 24 hours by default and is configurable.

   :::

3. Go to **Authentication** and navigate to **Database**.
4. Click the connection for which you want to export user data and copy its ID.

### Run export script

The export script accounts for all possible metrics you can export in a bulk user export. The bulk user export is a compressed,
newline-delimited JSON file. The process takes some time to complete and the compressed file is downloaded automatically when it's
ready.

Follow these steps to export the user data:

1. Export the required environment variables:

   ```shell
   export AUTH0_DOMAIN="your_auth0_domain.auth0.com"
   export AUTH0_CONNECTION_ID="your_auth0_connection_id"
   export AUTH0_TOKEN="your_auth0_management_api_token"
   ```

2. Run the export script:

   ```shell
   bash <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ory/docs/master/code-examples/migrate-to-ory/0-get-auth0-user-data.sh)
   ```

   This export script creates `AUTH0_USERDATA.json` in your current directory and contains all the exported user data.

### Export password hashes

Exporting password hashes is optional but recommended. Because password hashes are considered sensitive information, Auth0 doesn't
export them as part of the general export process. To get the password hashes and other password-related information, you must
[create an Auth0 support ticket](#create-auth0-support-ticket).

- If you get your users' password hashes and import them to Ory, users can log in to their accounts using the same credentials
  they used before the migration. For more information, see
  [Bulk identity migration](../migrate-to-ory/migrate/migrate-strategies#bulk-identity-migration).

- If you can't get users' password hashes, you can still import Auth0 user accounts to Ory and migrate the hashes using a
  [Password migration hook](../kratos/manage-identities/25_import-user-accounts-identities.mdx). For more information, see
  [Graceful identity migration](../migrate-to-ory/migrate/migrate-strategies#graceful-identity-migration).

:::note

Password hash exports are not available for Auth0's Free subscription tier. You'll need a paid Auth0 plan to request this data.

:::

#### Create Auth0 support ticket

Follow these steps to get the password hashes from Auth0. For more information, see the
[Auth0 documentation on exporting password hashes](https://auth0.com/docs/troubleshoot/customer-support/manage-subscriptions/export-data#user-passwords).

1. Go to your [Auth0 dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/#) and select **Get Support**.
2. Navigate to **Tickets** → **View All** and select **Open Ticket**.
3. Choose **I have a question regarding my Auth0 account** and pick the **I would like to obtain an export of my tenant password
   hashes** option.
4. Fill in the form and submit the ticket.

#### Download password hashes file

When Auth0 processes your request, download the compressed JSON file that contains user IDs, password hashes, and related
information.

The file you get has this format:

```json
[
  {
    "_ID": { "$oid": "60425dc43519d90068f82973" },
    "email_verified": false,
    "email": "test2@example.com",
    "passwordHash": "$2b$10$Z6hUTEEeoJXN5/AmSm/4.eZ75RYgFVriQM9LPhNEC7kbAbS/VAaJ2",
    "password_set_date": { "$date": "2021-03-05T16:35:16.775Z" },
    "tenant": "dev-rwsbs6ym",
    "connection": "Username-Password-Authentication",
    "_tmp_is_unique": true
  },
  {
    "_ID": { "$oid": "60425da93519d90068f82966" },
    "email_verified": false,
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "passwordHash": "$2b$10$CSZ2JarG4XYbGa.JkfpqnO2wrlbfp5eb5LScHSGo9XGeZ.a.Ic54S",
    "password_set_date": { "$date": "2021-03-05T16:34:49.502Z" },
    "tenant": "dev-rwsbs6ym",
    "connection": "Username-Password-Authentication",
    "_tmp_is_unique": true
  }
]
```

## Configure your Ory project

### Set environment variables

Set your project and workspace IDs as environment variables:

```shell
export ORY_PROJECT_ID='{your-project-id}'
export ORY_WORKSPACE_ID='{your-workspace-id}'
```

:::tip Finding your IDs

If you don't have these values, you can retrieve them:

- Using the CLI: Run `ory list projects` to see all your projects and their IDs
- Using the Console: Go to [Ory Console](https://console.ory.sh/), select your project, and find the IDs in the project settings

:::

### Configure identity schema

Before importing users, you need to configure your Ory project's identity schema to match your Auth0 setup. Since Auth0 users
authenticate with email and password, configure the identity schema to use the email preset.

Update your project's identity schema:

```shell
ory patch identity-config --project $ORY_PROJECT_ID --workspace $ORY_WORKSPACE_ID \
   --replace '/identity/default_schema_id="preset://email"' \
   --replace '/identity/schemas=[{"id":"preset://email","url":"base64: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"}]'
```

## Import users to Ory

The migration import script processes your exported Auth0 user data and creates corresponding identities in Ory. You can inspect
the import script
[here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ory/docs/master/code-examples/migrate-to-ory/1-create-ory-identities.sh).

### Set environment variables

Set necessary environment variables for the import script:

```shell
export RESERVE_ONLY="false" # Set to "true" if you DON'T HAVE Auth0 password hashes.
export AUTH0_USERDATA="{path-to-the-json-file-with-bulk-user-export-data}"
export AUTH0_PWEXPORT="{path-to-the-json-file-with-password-hashes}"
```

:::info Migration Mode

- Set `RESERVE_ONLY="false"` if you have password hashes
- Set `RESERVE_ONLY="true"` if you don't have password hashes

:::

### Run the import script

Execute the import script to import users:

```shell
bash <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ory/docs/master/code-examples/migrate-to-ory/1-create-ory-identities.sh)
```

## Post-migration steps

After the import script completes, follow these steps to verify and finalize the migration:

1. Verify the migration: Check the list of users available in your project to confirm the import was successful:

   ```shell
   ory list identities --project $ORY_PROJECT_ID --workspace $ORY_WORKSPACE_ID
   ```

2. Test user login: Try logging in with a few test accounts to ensure the migration was successful.

3. Enable account recovery (if migrating without password hashes):

   - Users will need to reset their passwords on first login
   - Ensure [account recovery](../kratos/self-service/flows/account-recovery-password-reset) is enabled

4. Communicate with users: Inform your users about:

   - The migration timeline
   - Any actions they need to take (password reset if migrating without password hashes)
   - How to get support if they encounter issues

5. Monitor the migration: Keep track of user login attempts and any issues that arise during the first few days after migration.
