# Understand your current IAM system

Below are example IAM scenarios supported by Ory Network. Use them to identify which scenario best fits your specific IAM needs and 
understand the unique requirements of each approach. Each scenario differs in complexity and implementation needs. Use these IAM 
scenarios to map the identity flows for your application.

## Identify your IAM scenario
- [CIAM](#ciam-customer-identity-and-access-management)
- [B2B](#b2b-business-to-business)
- [Workforce](#workforce-business-to-enterprise)
- [Agentic AI](#agentic-ai)


### CIAM (Customer Identity and Access Management)

Your company sells products or services directly to individual consumers.

#### Key IAM requirements
- Self-service registration, login, and profile management for end users
- Social login, multi-factor passwordless options, and robust account recovery
- Privacy compliance (GDPR, CCPA)
- High-scale performance for millions of users

### B2B (Business-to-Business)

Your company sells products or services directly to other businesses rather than individual consumers. Your customers are organizations 
that use these products or services to run their own operations.

#### Key IAM requirements

- Multi-organization user management
- SSO with SAML/OIDC providers
- Self-service partner onboarding
- Role-based permissions and API controls
- Privacy compliance (GDPR, CCPA)
- High-scale performance for millions of users

### Workforce (Business-to-Enterprise)

Your company provides products or services. Your company wants to manage access for a single organization's extended workforce. You want to 
consolidate employee user accounts and identities across multi-tenant brands, applications and systems. You need to seamlessly connect with 
existing enterprise identity providers and other 3rd party systems, and streamline user onboarding, offboarding, and permission management. 

#### Key IAM requirements
- Streamline onboarding/offboarding of employee, contractor, and temporary workers
- Role-based access aligned with organizational hierarchy
- HR system integration with flexible identity schemas
- Integrate with enterprise identity providers and third-party systems
- Time-bound permissions and role assignments
- Zero-trust security, MFA, and SSO for enterprise applications
- Privacy compliance (GDPR, CCPA)
- High-scale performance for millions of users

### Agentic AI

Your company wants to enable AI applications to securely connect to data sources and tools. For example, servers that host resources and
clients (AI applications) that discover and use those resources. 

#### Key IAM requirements
- Standardized protocol that works across many tools and data sources
- Built-in authentication and access control

## Map all identity flows in your application

Build a complete picture of every identity-related process in your system. Use your IAM scenario’s Key IAM requirements to identify 
these flows. This ensures you don’t miss critical flows during migration.

1. Identify all entry points where an identity-related process occurs (e.g., web app login, mobile app sign-in, API tokens, social or enterprise sign-ins).
1. Create a comprehensive inventory of flows, for example:
    - Registration/sign-up
    - Sign-in/sign-out
    - Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
    - Password reset and account recovery
    - Account linking (social, enterprise logins)
    - User profile management
    - Token refresh and session handling
    - Recovery flows, consent screens, or partner-specific integrations
1. Create flow diagrams (sequence diagrams or flow charts) to surface dependencies and hidden complexity.
1. Note where identity-related (authentication and authorization) processes interact with other systems (databases, CRMs, partner apps, or external APIs).

At the end of this process you should have a living document with diagrams that capture:

- All identity-related (authentication and authorization) flows
- Your system's existing functionality
- Any existing dependencies on external systems
- Edge cases requiring special handling

This will serve as your blueprint for planning, designing, testing, and validating your migration.
