With authentication now set up on your frontend and backend, the next step is to prepare your existing user identities for
migration. You should have already chosen your identity migration strategy in
[Choose your IAM migration strategy](https://www.ory.com/docs/migrate-to-ory/migrate/migrate-strategies): bulk or graceful
identity migration. You will now implement your chosen identity migration strategy.

- For Auth0 migrations, see the dedicated [Migrate user identities from Auth0 to Ory](../migrate-from-auth0) guide.

## Bulk identity migration

If you're using a managed identity solution, start the export of existing identities early, especially if there's no
straightforward way to export the identities and you might need to go through a support process. Identify the hashing algorithm
used for credentials. If your passwords aren't hashed, Ory handles hashing automatically during import. If Ory supports your
hashing algorithm, use the [`createIdentity`](https://www.ory.com/docs/reference/api#tag/identity/operation/createIdentity) API to
import users. If the hashing algorithm isn't supported or if you can't get the hashed passwords from your current authentication
system, you may want to do a graceful identity migration.

The `createIdentity` API supports bulk imports with a maximum of 1000 identities per request—larger imports require multiple
requests. The endpoint accepts a JSON array of identities, each of which must have a create property containing the identity data.
See the [Import identities](../../kratos/manage-identities/25_import-user-accounts-identities.mdx) documentation for complete
details.

## Graceful identity migration

Ory does not support the direct import of active sessions from your existing system. To ensure that users with active sessions can
continue accessing your services without needing to reauthenticate immediately, implement a transition period where both systems
operate concurrently. During this period, use the
[password migration hook](https://www.ory.com/docs/kratos/manage-identities/import-user-accounts-identities#password-migration-using-a-web-hook)
to migrate existing users. All user authentication flows—including login, registration, password recovery, and settings
management—should be managed by Ory. However, your backend must be configured to recognize and accept sessions from both the old
system and Ory. As the transition progresses, gradually phase out the old system. Once most or all active sessions from the old
system have expired or been replaced by new sessions in Ory, you can complete the migration to Ory exclusively. This gradual
approach minimizes user disruption and provides your development team with time to resolve any issues that arise during the
migration.
