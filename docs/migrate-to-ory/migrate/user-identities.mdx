With authentication now set up on your front end and back end, the next step is to prepare your existing user identities for
migration. 

## Get existing user identities ready for migration
If you're using a managed identity solution, it’s a good idea to start the export process early, especially if there's
no straightforward way to export the identities and you might need to go through a support process.

Export user data from your existing authentication solution or database and find out the hashing algorithm used to hash their
credentials. If your passwords are not hashed, you can bypass this step, as Ory will handle password hashing automatically during
the import process. Ory supports a range of hashing algorithms; if yours is supported, use the
[create identity API](../../reference/api#tag/identity/operation/createIdentity) to import your users. If the hashing algorithm isn't
supported or if you can't get the hashed passwords from your current authentication system, you may want to do a "graceful"
migration and use the password migration hook to migrate your existing users. You can find more details in the
[Import identities ](../../kratos/manage-identities/25_import-user-accounts-identities.mdx) documentation.

## Import user identities

You can use the [create identity API] (../../reference/api#tag/identity/operation/batchPatchIdentities) to bulk import identities into
Ory. A maximum of 2000 identities can be created in a single request. If you need to import more identities, you need to split the
import into multiple requests. The endpoint accepts a JSON array of identities, each of which must have a create property that
holds the identity that should be created. You can find more details in the
[Import identities ](../../kratos/manage-identities/25_import-user-accounts-identities.mdx) documentation.

### Phased migration for active sessions

Ory does not support the direct import of active sessions from your existing system. To ensure that users with active sessions
from the old system can continue accessing your services without needing to reauthenticate immediately, implement a transition
period during which both the old and new systems operate concurrently. During this period, all user authentication flows—including
login, registration, password recovery, and settings management—should be managed by Ory. However, your backend must be configured
to recognize and accept sessions from both the old system and Ory.

As the transition progresses, gradually phase out the old system. Once most or all active sessions from the old system have
expired or been replaced by new sessions in Ory, you can complete the migration to Ory exclusively. This gradual approach
minimizes user disruption and provides your development team with the time needed to resolve any potential issues that may arise
during the migration.
