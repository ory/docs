To make authenticated API calls using Ory, start by properly configuring your domain and subdomains. By default the cookie domain
is set to the root domain (e.g., example.org) when you add a custom domain. This ensures that cookies can be shared across all
subdomains.

Example subdomain structure:

- Run Ory at auth.example.org.
- Host your backend API at api.example.org.
- Serve your frontend UI at www.example.org or another designated subdomain.

This setup allows both your frontend and backend applications to access the authentication session cookies managed by Ory.

To begin integrating Ory into your frontend, start with the ["protect a page with login" guides](../../getting-started/overview)
that cover the basics of developing with Ory for various programming languages and frameworks, including SDK usage and essential
setup steps.

## Account Experience

Ory Network has two types of user interfaces. We recommend starting with the built-in
[Account Experience](../../account-experience/index.mdx), which offers a standard user interface, covering all self-service flows
with the option to style branding to get you up and running.

## Custom user interface

If you prefer a custom user interface that matches your current design exactly, Ory allows you to create and style a custom UI
that integrates seamlessly with your existing setup. You can do this using the API directly, the SDK for your language, or, if you
are working in the React ecosystem, Ory Elements.

### Ory Elements

[Ory Elements](../../elements/index.mdx) is a component library designed to make building login, registration, and account pages
for Ory easy. It is modular and customizable, allowing you to use only the components you need while tailoring them to fit your
implementation's design. The UI created with Ory Elements changes dynamically to adapt to your Ory Network configuration.
