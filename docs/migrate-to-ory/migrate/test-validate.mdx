Before going live with your Ory Network integration, thorough testing across multiple environments is essential to ensure your
authentication system works securely and reliably. You should test progressively through development, staging, and production
environments, validating that configurations, custom domains, and integrations work correctly at each stage.

## Create a comprehensive list of testing requirements

Your testing should cover:

- Authentication flows: Login, registration, password reset, account recovery
- Session management: Creation, validation, expiration, security
- Data integrity: User profiles, metadata synchronization, permissions
- API functionality: All protected routes, authorization checks
- User interface: Forms, redirects, error handling, responsive design
- Performance: Response times, concurrent user handling, load capacity
- Security: CSRF protection, session security, data encryption

## Implement systematic validation to ensure migration completeness

Your validation should cover:

- Compare user counts between systems (should match within acceptable margin)
- Validate authentication flows for representative sample users
- Verify all business logic continues to function correctly
- Conduct user acceptance testing with representative user groups to ensure the migrated system meets usability requirements and
  maintains expected functionality.
