Before going live with your Ory Network integration, thorough testing across multiple environments is essential 
to ensure your authentication system works securely and reliably. You should test progressively through development, 
staging, and production environments, validating that configurations, custom domains, and integrations work correctly 
at each stage. 

Create a comprehensive list of testing requirements. For example:

- Authentication Flows: Login, registration, password reset, account recovery
- Session Management: Creation, validation, expiration, security
- Data Integrity: User profiles, metadata synchronization, permissions
- API Functionality: All protected routes, authorization checks
- User Interface: Forms, redirects, error handling, responsive design
- Performance: Response times, concurrent user handling, load capacity
- Security: CSRF protection, session security, data encryption

## Migration Validation Process
Implement systematic validation to ensure migration completeness, data accuracy, and functional parity with existing systems. 
Compare user counts between systems, validate authentication flows for sample users, and verify all business logic continues 
to function correctly.

## User Acceptance Testing
Conduct thorough user acceptance testing with representative user groups to ensure the migrated system meets usability 
requirements and maintains expected functionality.
