## Define identity schema

To match identities from your current system with the new Ory system, you can customize the identity schema in Ory to meet your
specific requirements. This schema defines the types of data that the system can store for users, including names, email
addresses, phone numbers, and other authentication-related information. Additionally, you can specify extra metadata fields to be
included in user profiles. Ory offers default presets to assist you in creating and managing identity schemas. More details about
identity schemas can be found [here](../kratos/manage-identities/identity-schema).

- Do store profile data in your identity that is used across your system. This includes the usernames, email addresses, phone
  numbers, first names, and last names.
- Do not store business logic in your identity, store this information in other systems, such as your application database. This
  includes for example credit card information, shipping addresses, shopping cart items, or user preferences. See also the
  following section on backend integration.
