When migrating user data from an old system to a new one, the process involves two main steps: transferring existing data and
"go-live" when users start authenticating with the new system. The choice of migration strategy depends on your specific use case,
the shape of existing data, and the number of "go-lives" you need to manage.

- **Big bang** - Migrate everyone at once.
- **Stepped** - Migrate your applications or user segments individually. _This is the most common choice_.
- **Graceful** - Migrate when a user authenticates, running both solutions in parallel.

Each migration strategy has its strengths and challenges. The ideal choice depends on factors such as the complexity of your
system, the number of users, and your organization's tolerance for risk and downtime.

### Big bang migration

In a big bang migration, also known as "offline migration", all user data is transferred at once, and a single "go-live" event is
scheduled, where all users start using the new system simultaneously.

#### Advantages of big bang migration

- Simplicity: Since there is only one "go-live", the migration process is easier to manage and plan.
- Time efficiency: The migration process happens in one go, reducing the time needed for the transition.
- Less complexity: There is no need to run two systems in parallel and you can retire the previous solution immediately.

#### Drawbacks of big bang migration

- High risk: If any issues occur during the cutover, the impact can be significant, affecting all users.
- Downtime: This approach may require planned system downtime to ensure data consistency, which can disrupt users.
- Increased preparation: Requires extensive planning and testing to mitigate risks, making it more resource-intensive during that
  phase.

A big bang migration is often not the best choice due to the risk and downtime, but it is recommended when

- the number of users is low / app is simple
- downtime isn't a problem
- you need to retire the current solution yesterday

### Stepwise migration

Stepwise migration, also called "application-based migration", involves transferring user data in phases, focusing on specific
applications, services, or user segments at a time. This approach results in multiple "go-lives", each affecting a defined group
of users.

#### Advantages of stepwise migration

- Reduced risk: By migrating in phases, issues are isolated to specific apps or user segments.
- Flexibility: Allows for adjustments and optimizations between phases based on lessons learned.
- Minimized/no downtime: Since the migration occurs in stages, downtime can be limited to smaller user groups or avoided
  completely.

#### Drawbacks of stepwise migration

- Complex management: Multiple "go-lives" require more coordination and detailed planning, increasing operational complexity.
- Extended timeline: The migration process takes longer as it is broken down into phases.
- Resource demands: Running both systems in parallel during the transition can strain resources.

A stepwise migration is the best choice in most cases, especially when

- you manage multiple apps/segments of users with different underlying auth systems
- downtime should be mostly avoided
- you have some time to migrate

### Graceful migration

Graceful migration - also called "slow migration", "rolling migration", or "online migration" - involves running both the old and
new systems in parallel, gradually migrating users as they authenticate. This approach features two "go-lives": the initial
application "go-live" and subsequent user-specific cutovers during login.

#### Advantages of graceful migration

- Low risk: The gradual transition reduces the risk of widespread issues, as only a few users are affected at any given time.
- No hashed credentials needed: Users are migrated during their "normal" authentication process, so you don't need to import
  credentials. Great if you don't have access to the hashed credentials.
- No downtime: Both systems operate simultaneously until the migration is completed.

#### Drawbacks of graceful migration

- Extended migration period: The process takes longer as users are migrated individually over time.
- Increased complexity: Maintaining synchronization between two systems adds complexity to the migration process.
- Potential for data inconsistencies: If not carefully managed, there may be discrepancies between the two systems during the
  transition period.

A graceful migration is a good choice when

- you don't have access to hashed credentials or they are hashed with a proprietary algorithm
- absolutely no downtime is acceptable
- running the current solution until the end of migration isn't a problem

## Create Ory Network projects

Now that you have chosen your migration strategy, you can begin the actual migration process by setting up your Ory Network
projects. This involves creating a new project environment where the migration will take place.

You can create a new Ory Network project using the Ory CLI. The command ory create project allows you to specify the environment
of the project, the output format, the name of the project, and the workspace to use. More details about creating a project can be
found [here](../../cli/ory-create-project).

Before migrating your production environment, perform the migration in a development or staging environment. This allows you to
test and refine the process without affecting your live data or users.
