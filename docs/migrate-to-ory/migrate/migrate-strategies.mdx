This section covers two aspects of migrating to Ory: transferring user identities and rolling out IAM functionality to your
applications. User identity migration involves moving user accounts, credentials, and profile data from your existing system to
Ory. IAM rollout determines the sequence and timing for transitioning each application to use Ory for authentication and
authorization.

These two aspects are distinct but interconnected. You might choose different identity migration strategies for different
applications or rollout phases. For example, you could use bulk identity migration for your first application in a single-phased
rollout, and later use graceful identity migration for subsequent multi-phased rollouts. Understanding both aspects helps you
design a transition plan that balances technical constraints, business priorities, and user impact. Your choice of approach should
be driven by several key factors: the complexity of your system, the size of your user base, and your organization's risk
tolerance and downtime constraints.

## Choose your IAM system rollout strategy

Simpler systems with homogeneous user segments and a single legacy authentication system can be implemented in a single-phase IAM
system rollout. However, complex systems or risk-averse organizations may benefit from a multi-phased, application-based, or
phased rollout approach. This strategy allows you to test processes in production by first rolling out to less critical user
segments or applications, learning valuable lessons to refine your approach before a broader rollout.

### Single-phase rollout

A single-phase approach involves migrating user identities and rolling out applications/services in a single "go-live" event. This
approach results in all users and applications/services being impacted at the same time. The single-phase rollout requires you to
perform a bulk identity migration.

A single-phase rollout approach is the best choice when:

- The number of users is low and applications or services are simple
- Planned system downtime due to the "go-live" event isn't a problem
- You need to retire the current solution soon

#### Advantages of single-phase rollout

- Faster time to value: All users gain access to the new system immediately rather than waiting months or years for their turn.
- Simplifies planning: You only need to plan, execute, and close out one major deployment rather than coordinating multiple phases
  with interdependencies, handoffs, and varying timelines.
- Lower total cost: Running one migration event typically costs less than maintaining parallel systems, conducting multiple
  training sessions, and supporting both old and new systems across an extended timeline.
- Eliminates integration complexity: You avoid the technical challenges and data synchronization issues that arise when different
  user groups operate on different systems that need to communicate with each other.

#### Drawbacks of single-phase rollout

- Higher risk concentration: If something goes wrong during deployment, it impacts your entire organization simultaneously rather
  than being contained to a smaller group, potentially causing widespread business disruption.
- Support burden: Your support team must handle issues from all users at once, which can lead to long resolution times, frustrated
  users, and inability to provide quality assistance when everyone needs help simultaneously.
- Limited learning opportunity: You can't incorporate lessons learned from early adopters because there are no early adopters—any
  design flaws, training gaps, or technical issues only become apparent when it's too late to adjust your approach.
- Difficult rollback: Reverting to the old system after a full cutover can be complex and potentially impossible if you've already
  decommissioned infrastructure or migrated data irreversibly.

### Multi-phase rollout

A multi-phase approach involves migrating user identities and rolling out applications/services in phases, focusing on specific
applications, services, or user segments. This approach results in multiple "go-lives", each affecting a defined group of users or
applications/services. A multi-phase approach can employ bulk or graceful identity imigration strategies, or a hybrid of both. The
key difference is that a specific segment of users or authenication for a specific application or service is rolled out
separately, each in its own specific phase.

A multi-phase rollout is the best choice in most cases, especially when:

- You manage multiple enterpise-level applications with different underlying authentication systems
- You manage diverse segments of users with different underlying authentication systems
- You have a complex system, and you want to reduce the risk of unknown consequences and improve the process iteratively.

#### Advantages of multi-phase rollout

- Reduced risk: By rolling out in phases, issues are isolated to specific apps or user segments.
- Flexibility: Allows for adjustments and optimizations between phases based on lessons learned.
- Minimized/no downtime: Since the rollout occurs in stages, downtime can be limited to smaller user groups or avoided completely.

#### Drawbacks of multi-phase rollout

- Complex management: Multiple "go-lives" require more coordination and detailed planning, increasing operational complexity.
- Extended timeline: The time to roll out the whole system takes longer as it is broken down into phases.
- Resource demands: Running both systems in parallel during the transition can strain resources. </TabItem>

## Choose your user identity migration strategy

Ory supports two primary identity migration strategies:

- **Bulk identity migration** - Migrate all users at once.
- **Graceful identity migration** - Migrate when a user authenticates, running old and new solutions in parallel.

By understanding these methods and planning accordingly, you can ensure a smooth and secure transition for your users to Ory
Network.

  defaultValue="bulk"
  values={[
    {label: 'Bulk identity migration', value: 'bulk'},
    {label: 'Graceful identity migration', value: 'graceful'},
  ]}>
<TabItem value="bulk">

### Bulk identity migration

In a bulk identity migration, also known as big-bang or offline migration, all user data is migrated at once. The identity
migration must happen in close coordination with the overall rollout. This creates a single "go-live" event, where all users
included in the bulk identity migration start using the new system simultaneously.

#### When to use bulk identity migration

A bulk identity migration can involve some risk and downtime, but it is recommended when:

- The number of users is low and applications or services are simple
- Planned system downtime due to the "go-live" event isn't a problem
- You need to retire the current solution soon
- Your legacy IAM vendor restricts your ability to use a graceful identity migration strategy.

##### Advantages of bulk identity migration

- Simplifies planning: Since there is only one "go-live", the identity migration process is easier to manage and plan.
- Reduces transition time: The identity migration process happens in one go, reducing the transition time.
- Less complexity: There is no need to run two systems in parallel and you can retire the previous solution immediately after
  testing and validating the migration.

##### Drawbacks of bulk identity migration

- High risk: If any issues occur during the cutover, the impact can be significant, affecting all users. It might be difficult to
  perform a rollback.
- Downtime: This approach may require planned system downtime to ensure data consistency, which can disrupt users.
- Increased preparation: Requires extensive planning and testing to mitigate risks, making it more resource-intensive during that
  phase. </TabItem>

### Graceful identity migration

Graceful identity migration—also called automatic, trickle, just-in-time, or online migration—involves running both the old and
new systems in parallel, gradually migrating user identities as the user authenticates. This approach features two "go-lives": the
initial application "go-live" and subsequent user-specific cutovers during login.

#### When to use graceful identity migration

A graceful identity migration is a good choice when:

- You don't have access to hashed credentials or they are hashed with a proprietary algorithm
- Authentication system downtime is not acceptable
- Running the current solution until the end of migration isn't a problem
- You need a smooth user experience, so your users will not notice the migration

##### Advantages of graceful identity migration

- Low risk: The gradual identity migration reduces the risk of widespread issues, as only a few users are affected at any given
  time.
- No hashed credentials needed: Users are migrated during their "normal" authentication process, so you don't need to import
  credentials. Great if you don't have access to the hashed credentials.
- No downtime: Both authentication systems operate simultaneously until the identity migration is completed.

##### Drawbacks of graceful identity migration

- Extended migration period: The process takes longer as users are migrated individually over time.
- Increased complexity: Maintaining synchronization between two systems adds complexity to the migration process. (You need to
  ensure identites are synchronized in both systems in case a rollback is required.) In addition, a graceful migration requires
  additional coding effort to implement Ory's
  [password migration using a web hook](https://www.ory.com/docs/kratos/manage-identities/import-user-accounts-identities#password-migration-using-a-web-hook).
- Potential for data inconsistencies: If not carefully managed, there may be discrepancies between the old and new systems during
  the transition period. </TabItem>
