Now that you have chosen your migration strategy, you can begin the actual migration process. Perform the migration in a 
development or staging environment before migrating to your production environment. This allows you to test and refine the 
process without affecting your live data or users.

1. Get an [Ory Network account](https://console.ory.sh/login?flow=c59cbae0-ea41-44e4-b46a-f9e1857be3a2).
1. Install Ory CLI and [set up your local environment](https://www.ory.com/docs/getting-started/local-development) to start 
developing with Ory.
1. Create an Ory project and get your Ory project ID.
1. [Set up the necessary dependencies and configurations](https://www.ory.com/docs/identities/get-started/setup) to integrate 
Ory's features into your application.
1. Review a [quick start](https://www.ory.com/docs/welcome) for your framework.

You can use the Ory CLI to specify the environment of the project, the output format, the name of the project, and the workspace to use. 
See the [Ory CLI Reference](../../cli/ory-create-project) for the `ory create project` command and additional options.
