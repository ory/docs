Now that you have chosen your migration strategy, you can begin the actual migration process by setting up your Ory Network
projects. This involves creating a new project environment where the migration will take place.

You can create a new Ory Network project using the Ory CLI. The command ory create project allows you to specify the environment
of the project, the output format, the name of the project, and the workspace to use. More details about creating a project can be
found [here](../../cli/ory-create-project).

Before migrating your production environment, perform the migration in a development or staging environment. This allows you to
test and refine the process without affecting your live data or users.
