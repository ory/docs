# Migrate to Ory Network

Before you can migrate smoothly, you need a complete picture of how your identity management system works today. This step ensures 
nothing gets missed — from everyday login flows to rare edge cases — and sets the foundation for mapping existing features to 
Ory Network's equivalent features.

Why it matters: Not understanding your existing system’s behavior is the #1 cause of unexpected regressions during cutover. With 
Ory Network, you gain full control, and with it, the ability to shape your system’s flows exactly to your needs.

# Understand your current identity management system

Below are example IAM scenarios supported by Ory Network. Use them to identify which scenario best fits your specific needs and 
understand the unique requirements of each approach. Each scenario differs in complexity and implementation needs. Use these IAM 
scenarios to help identify and map the authentication flows for your application.

## Identify your IAM scenario
- CIAM
- B2B
- Workforce
- Agentic AI

### CIAM (Customer Identity and Access Management)

Your company sells products or services directly to individual consumers.

#### Key IAM requirements
- Self-service registration, login, and profile management for end users
- Social login, multi-factor passwordless options, and robust account recovery
- Privacy compliance (GDPR, CCPA)
- High-scale performance for millions of users

#### Ory Network features
- Identity management & authenitication (based on Ory Kratos)
- Authorization (based on Ory Hydra, optional for OAuth2/OIDC)

### B2B (Business-to-Business)

Your company sells products or services directly to other businesses rather than individual consumers. Your customers are organizations 
that use these products or services to run their own operations.

#### Key IAM requirements

- Multi-organization user management
- SSO with SAML/OIDC providers
- Self-service partner onboarding
- Role-based permissions and API controls

#### Ory Network features

- Identity management & authenitication (based on Ory Kratos)
- Authorization and single sign-on (based on Ory Hydra/Ory Polis)
- Permissions (based on Ory Ketos)
- Zero-trust access proxy (based on Ory Oathkeeper)

### Workforce (Business-to-Enterprise)

Your company provides products or services. Your company wants to manage access for a single organization's extended workforce. You want to 
consolidate employee user accounts and identities across multi-tenant brands, applications and systems. You need to seamlessly connect with 
existing enterprise identity providers and other 3rd party systems and streamline user onboarding, offboarding, and permission management. 

#### Key IAM requirements
- Streamline onboarding/offboarding of employee, contractor, and temporary workers
- Role-based access aligned with organizational hierarchy
- HR system integration with flexible identity schemas
- Integrate with enterprise identity providers and third-party systems
- Time-bound permissions and role assignments
- Zero-trust security, MFA, and SSO for enterprise applications

#### Ory Network features
- Identity management & authenitication (based on Ory Kratos) 
- Authorization and single sign-on (based on Ory Hydra/Ory Polis)
- Permissions (based on Ory Ketos)
- Zero-trust access proxy (based on Ory Oathkeeper)
- Webhooks

### Agentic AI

Your company wants to enable AI applications to securely connect to data sources and tools. For example, servers that host resources and
clients (AI applications) to discover and use those resources. 

#### Key IAM requirements
- Standardized protocol that works across many tools and data sources
- Built-in authentication and access control

#### Ory Network features
- Identity management & authenitication (based on Ory Kratos)
- Authorization (based on Ory Hydra)
- Permissions (based on Ory Ketos)
- Zero-trust access proxy (based on Ory Oathkeeper)

## Map all authentication and identity flows in your application

Build a complete picture of every authentication-related process in your system. Use your IAM scenario’s Key IAM requirements to help identify 
authentication and identity flows. This ensures you don’t miss critical flows during migration.

1. Identify all entry points where authentication occurs (e.g., web app login, mobile app sign-in, API tokens, social or enterprise sign-ins).
1. Create a comprehensive inventory of flows, for example:
    - Registration / Sign-up
    - Sign-in/Sign-out
    - Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
    - Password reset and account recovery
    - Account linking (social, enterprise logins)
    - User profile management
    - Token refresh and session handling
    - Recovery flows, consent screens, or partner-specific integrations
1. Visualize flows with diagrams (sequence diagrams or flow charts) to surface dependencies and hidden complexity.
1. Note where authentication interacts with other systems (databases, CRMs, partner apps, or external APIs).


### Map your existing IAM functionality to Ory Network’s equivalent capabilities
Using your list of authentication and identity flows, create a side-by-side table to map out existing functionality and Ory Network’s equivalent 
capabilities. While the majority of the time you'll find your existing functionality neatly maps to Ory's capabilities, now is the best time to
identify when it does not. Some examples:

- Not all vendors strickly comply with standards, whereas Ory does, so you might discover you need to
change how you implement functionality to be compliant. 
- You might have a unique use case to solve that requires additional help from our support.

Table 1: An example of mapping functionality

| Existing Functionality | Ory Capabilities |
|---|---|
| JSON Web Tokens | [Ory Session cookies/tokens](https://www.ory.sh/docs/identities/session-to-jwt-cors)|

At the end of this process you should have a living document with diagrams that capture:

- All authentication and identity flows
- Your system's existing functionality and Ory Network's equivalent capabilites
- Any existing dependencies on external systems
- Edge cases requiring special handling

This will serve as your blueprint for planning, designing, testing, and validating your migration.

## Migration strategy

When migrating user data from an old system to a new one, the process involves two main steps: transferring existing data and
"go-live" when users start authenticating with the new system. The choice of migration strategy depends on your specific use case,
the shape of existing data, and the number of "go-lives" you need to manage.

- **Big bang** - Migrate everyone at once.
- **Stepped** - Migrate your applications or user segments individually. _This is the most common choice_.
- **Graceful** - Migrate when a user authenticates, running both solutions in parallel.

Each migration strategy has its strengths and challenges. The ideal choice depends on factors such as the complexity of your
system, the number of users, and your organization's tolerance for risk and downtime.

### Big bang migration

In a big bang migration, also known as "offline migration", all user data is transferred at once, and a single "go-live" event is
scheduled, where all users start using the new system simultaneously.

#### Advantages of big bang migration

- Simplicity: Since there is only one "go-live", the migration process is easier to manage and plan.
- Time efficiency: The migration process happens in one go, reducing the time needed for the transition.
- Less complexity: There is no need to run two systems in parallel and you can retire the previous solution immediately.

#### Drawbacks of big bang migration

- High risk: If any issues occur during the cutover, the impact can be significant, affecting all users.
- Downtime: This approach may require planned system downtime to ensure data consistency, which can disrupt users.
- Increased preparation: Requires extensive planning and testing to mitigate risks, making it more resource-intensive during that
  phase.

A big bang migration is often not the best choice due to the risk and downtime, but it is recommended when

- the number of users is low / app is simple
- downtime isn't a problem
- you need to retire the current solution yesterday

### Stepwise migration

Stepwise migration, also called "application-based migration", involves transferring user data in phases, focusing on specific
applications, services, or user segments at a time. This approach results in multiple "go-lives", each affecting a defined group
of users.

#### Advantages of stepwise migration

- Reduced risk: By migrating in phases, issues are isolated to specific apps or user segments.
- Flexibility: Allows for adjustments and optimizations between phases based on lessons learned.
- Minimized/no downtime: Since the migration occurs in stages, downtime can be limited to smaller user groups or avoided
  completely.

#### Drawbacks of stepwise migration

- Complex management: Multiple "go-lives" require more coordination and detailed planning, increasing operational complexity.
- Extended timeline: The migration process takes longer as it is broken down into phases.
- Resource demands: Running both systems in parallel during the transition can strain resources.

A stepwise migration is the best choice in most cases, especially when

- you manage multiple apps/segments of users with different underlying auth systems
- downtime should be mostly avoided
- you have some time to migrate

### Graceful migration

Graceful migration - also called "slow migration", "rolling migration", or "online migration" - involves running both the old and
new systems in parallel, gradually migrating users as they authenticate. This approach features two "go-lives": the initial
application "go-live" and subsequent user-specific cutovers during login.

#### Advantages of graceful migration

- Low risk: The gradual transition reduces the risk of widespread issues, as only a few users are affected at any given time.
- No hashed credentials needed: Users are migrated during their "normal" authentication process, so you don't need to import
  credentials. Great if you don't have access to the hashed credentials.
- No downtime: Both systems operate simultaneously until the migration is completed.

#### Drawbacks of graceful migration

- Extended migration period: The process takes longer as users are migrated individually over time.
- Increased complexity: Maintaining synchronization between two systems adds complexity to the migration process.
- Potential for data inconsistencies: If not carefully managed, there may be discrepancies between the two systems during the
  transition period.

A graceful migration is a good choice when

- you don't have access to hashed credentials or they are hashed with a proprietary algorithm
- absolutely no downtime is acceptable
- running the current solution until the end of migration isn't a problem

## Create Ory Network projects

Now that you have chosen your migration strategy, you can begin the actual migration process by setting up your Ory Network
projects. This involves creating a new project environment where the migration will take place.

You can create a new Ory Network project using the Ory CLI. The command ory create project allows you to specify the environment
of the project, the output format, the name of the project, and the workspace to use. More details about creating a project can be
found [here](../cli/ory-create-project).

Before migrating your production environment, perform the migration in a development or staging environment. This allows you to
test and refine the process without affecting your live data or users.

## Define identity schema

To match identities from your current system with the new Ory system, you can customize the identity schema in Ory to meet your
specific requirements. This schema defines the types of data that the system can store for users, including names, email
addresses, phone numbers, and other authentication-related information. Additionally, you can specify extra metadata fields to be
included in user profiles. Ory offers default presets to assist you in creating and managing identity schemas. More details about
identity schemas can be found [here](../kratos/manage-identities/identity-schema).

- Do store profile data in your identity that is used across your system. This includes the usernames, email addresses, phone
  numbers, first names, and last names.
- Do not store business logic in your identity, store this information in other systems, such as your application database. This
  includes for example credit card information, shipping addresses, shopping cart items, or user preferences. See also the
  following section on backend integration.

## Integrate frontend

To make authenticated API calls using Ory, start by properly configuring your domain and subdomains. By default the cookie domain
is set to the root domain (e.g., example.org) when you add a custom domain. This ensures that cookies can be shared across all
subdomains.

- Example subdomain structure:
  - Run Ory at auth.example.org.
  - Host your backend API at api.example.org.
  - Serve your frontend UI at www.example.org or another designated subdomain.

This setup allows both your front end and back end to access the authentication session cookies managed by Ory.

To begin integrating Ory into your frontend, it's helpful to start with the
["protect a page with login" guides](../getting-started/overview) that cover the basics of developing with Ory for various
programming languages and frameworks, including SDK usage and essential setup steps.

Ory Network has two types of user interfaces. We recommend starting with the built-in
[Account Experience](../account-experience/index.mdx), which offers a standard user interface, covering all self-service flows
with the option to style branding to get you up and running. If you prefer a custom user interface that matches your current
design 1:1, Ory allows you to create and style a custom UI that integrates seamlessly with your existing setup. You can do this
using the API directly, the SDK for your language, or - if you are working in the React ecosystem - Ory Elements. Ory Elements is
a component library designed to make building login, registration, and account pages for Ory easy. It is modular and customizable,
allowing you to use only the components you need while tailoring them to fit your implementation's design. The UI created with Ory
Elements changes dynamically to adapt to your Ory Network configuration. More details about customizing the user interface with
Ory Elements can be found [here](../elements/index.mdx).

## Integrate backend

When the frontend makes an API call to your backend, it will include the necessary cookies. Your backend must then forward these
cookies when calling the Ory API to validate the session. For example in a Go backend, you could use a
[middleware](../getting-started/integrate-auth/go#validate-and-login) to intercept API requests and validate the session by
calling Ory’s toSession() method. Ensure that the cookies received from the front end are forwarded in this call. Since backend
calls to Ory’s API won’t automatically include cookies, you must manually attach the relevant cookies to these requests. This is
important for the backend to be able to check the session.

When using Ory to manage identities, it is best practice to store business logic in your application database and keep only
authentication-relevant data in Ory. Here’s a general approach:

1. Configure [Ory Actions](../kratos/hooks/configure-hooks) to send webhooks to your server after user registration or other
   identity-related events. The webhook payload will include the data of the newly created identity.
1. Upon receiving the webhook, your server can create a corresponding user record in your database. This allows your system to
   link Ory-managed identities with your business logic.
1. Establish a connection between the Ory identity and the user record in your database by storing the `user.id` in
   `identity.metadata_public.id`. This ensures that subsequent API calls can easily map the Ory identity to the correct internal
   user. More about metadata in the [Identity metadata & traits ](../kratos/manage-identities/managing-users-identities-metadata)
   documentation.
1. Now when the frontend makes API calls containing the Ory cookie or token, the backend should verify the session using the
   whoami API endpoint. This endpoint returns the session details, including the identity, allowing the backend to authenticate
   the request and link it to the internal user record.

## Get user data and credentials

With authentication now set up on your front end and back end, the next step is to prepare your existing user identities for
migration. If you're using a managed identity solution, it’s a good idea to start the export process early, especially if there's
no straightforward way to export the identities and you might need to go through a support process.

Export user data from your existing authentication solution or database and find out the hashing algorithm used to hash their
credentials. If your passwords are not hashed, you can bypass this step, as Ory will handle password hashing automatically during
the import process. Ory supports a range of hashing algorithms; if yours is supported, use the
[create identity API](../reference/api#tag/identity/operation/createIdentity) to import your users. If the hashing algorithm isn't
supported or if you can't get the hashed passwords from your current authentication system, you may want to do a "graceful"
migration and use the password migration hook to migrate your existing users. You can find more details in the
[Import identities ](../kratos/manage-identities/25_import-user-accounts-identities.mdx) documentation.

## Import identities

You can use the [create identity API](../reference/api#tag/identity/operation/batchPatchIdentities) to bulk import identities into
Ory. A maximum of 2000 identities can be created in a single request. If you need to import more identities, you need to split the
import into multiple requests. The endpoint accepts a JSON array of identities, each of which must have a create property that
holds the identity that should be created. You can find more details in the
[Import identities ](../kratos/manage-identities/25_import-user-accounts-identities.mdx) documentation.

### Phased migration for active sessions

Ory does not support the direct import of active sessions from your existing system. To ensure that users with active sessions
from the old system can continue accessing your services without needing to reauthenticate immediately, implement a transition
period during which both the old and new systems operate concurrently. During this period, all user authentication flows—including
login, registration, password recovery, and settings management—should be managed by Ory. However, your backend must be configured
to recognize and accept sessions from both the old system and Ory.

As the transition progresses, gradually phase out the old system. Once most or all active sessions from the old system have
expired or been replaced by new sessions in Ory, you can complete the migration to Ory exclusively. This gradual approach
minimizes user disruption and provides your development team with the time needed to resolve any potential issues that may arise
during the migration.

## Go live

After successfully migrating your data and testing the integration in your development or staging environment, it's time to go
live with Ory in your production environment.

1. Final testing: Before switching over to Ory in production, conduct thorough testing of all user authentication flows, identity
   management features, and access controls. This includes testing edge cases, error handling, and load testing to ensure the
   system can handle your user base.
1. Prepare a rollback plan: In case any issues arise during the go-live process, have a rollback plan in place. This may involve
   reverting to your previous authentication system or restoring data from backups.
1. Schedule the go-live: Choose a time for the go-live that minimizes the impact on your users, such as during low-traffic
   periods. Communicate the planned migration to your users in advance, including any expected downtime or changes they should be
   aware of.
1. Monitor the transition: As you switch over to Ory, closely monitor the system for any issues, such as failed authentications,
   performance bottlenecks, or user complaints. Use live events to monitor the system under
   <ConsoleLink route="project.activity.events" />.
1. Optimize and refine: After the go-live, continue to monitor the system and gather user feedback.

Once your Ory integration is stable and users are successfully authenticating with the new system, your migration is complete.
