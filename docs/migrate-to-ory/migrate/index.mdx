# Migrate to Ory Network

Before you can migrate smoothly, you need a complete picture of how your identity management system works today. This step ensures 
nothing gets missed — from everyday login flows to rare edge cases — and sets the foundation for mapping existing features to 
Ory Network's equivalent features.

Why it matters: Not understanding your existing system’s behavior is the #1 cause of unexpected regressions during cutover. With 
Ory Network, you gain full control, and with it, the ability to shape your system’s flows exactly to your needs.
