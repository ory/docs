Using your list of identity-related flows, create a side-by-side table to map existing functionality to Ory Network’s equivalent
capabilities. While most of the time you'll find your existing functionality neatly maps to Ory's capabilities, this is the best
time to identify when it does not. Some examples:

- Not all vendors strictly comply with standards, whereas Ory does, so you might need to change how you implement functionality to
  be compliant with standards
- You might have a unique use case that requires additional help from our support team
