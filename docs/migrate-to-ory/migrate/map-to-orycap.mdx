Using your list of identity flows, create a side-by-side table to map existing functionality to Ory Networkâ€™s equivalent 
capabilities. While the majority of the time you'll find your existing functionality neatly maps to Ory's capabilities, now is the best time to
identify when it does not. Some examples:

- Not all vendors strickly comply with standards, whereas Ory does, so you might discover you need to
change how you implement functionality to be compliant. 
- You might have a unique use case to solve that requires additional help from our support.
