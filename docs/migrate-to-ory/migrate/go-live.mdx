After successfully migrating your data and testing the integration in your development or staging environment, it's time to go
live with Ory in your production environment.

1. Final testing: Before switching over to Ory in production, conduct thorough testing of all user authentication flows, identity
   management features, and access controls. This includes testing edge cases, error handling, and load testing to ensure the
   system can handle your user base.
1. Prepare a rollback plan: In case any issues arise during the go-live process, have a rollback plan in place. This may involve
   reverting to your previous authentication system or restoring data from backups.
1. Schedule the go-live: Choose a time for the go-live that minimizes the impact on your users, such as during low-traffic
   periods. Communicate the planned migration to your users in advance, including any expected downtime or changes they should be
   aware of.
1. Monitor the transition: As you switch over to Ory, closely monitor the system for any issues, such as failed authentications,
   performance bottlenecks, or user complaints. To monitor the system, view live events at 
   <ConsoleLink route="project.activity.events" />.
1. Optimize and refine: After the go-live, continue to monitor the system, gather user feedback, and make adjustments as needed to 
improve performance and user experience.

Once your Ory integration is stable and users are successfully authenticating with the new system, your migration is complete.
Continue to leverage Ory's features to enhance your authentication and identity management over time.
