## Which deployment option?

The right option depends on your organization’s goals and how much control you want over your infrastructure.
If you need to maintain full control, meet strict compliance requirements, or operate at massive scale, Ory Enterprise License (OEL) is the best fit.
For teams that want zero infrastructure management and seamless scaling, Ory Network provides a fully managed platform.
And if you’re exploring, testing, or building prototypes, start with Ory Open Source or the Ory Network free tier.
All Ory products share the same open standards and APIs, so you can move between them without rewriting your code.
