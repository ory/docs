Ory's identity and access management platform is modular; each product handles a specific capability, and you combine them based on what 
your system needs. This section walks you through choosing the right deployment option for your system, understanding what each Ory 
product does, and seeing how products combine into solutions that address real-world authentication and authorization requirements.

## Which deployment option?

The right option depends on your organization’s goals and how much control you want over your infrastructure. If you need to
maintain full control, meet strict compliance requirements, or operate at massive scale, Ory Enterprise License (OEL) is the best
fit. For teams that want zero infrastructure management and seamless scaling, Ory Network provides a fully managed platform. And
if you’re exploring, testing, or building prototypes, start with Ory Open Source or the Ory Network free tier. All Ory deployment
options share the same open standards and APIs, so you can move between them without rewriting your code.

## Which Ory product?

Each Ory deployment option, provides everything you need to build a modern identity and access management system. Ory doesn't 
treat IAM as one monolithic system, we approach is as a set of layered responsibilities. Here’s how Ory maps core IAM concepts to our 
products, each acting as a composable building block. 

NOTE: Product names, features, and capabilities may vary between deployment options. The product descriptions below apply 
generally across all deployments.

### Match your IAM challenge to an Ory product

Choose Ory products based on the specific identity, authorization, or access control challenge you’re solving. 

| **IAM Concept / Layer**                                   | **Core IAM Question**                                                     | **Ory Product — What it does and how**                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Identity Management & Authentication                  | Who is the user and how do they sign in?                                      | **Ory Kratos** Manages user identities and handles direct authentication flows such as login, registration, account recovery, MFA-ready flows, and session management (cookies/jwt).                                       |
| Delegated, Scope-based Authorization & Token Issuance | Which application can act on behalf of a user, and with what level of access? | **Ory Hydra** Implements OAuth2 and OpenID Connect to issue access and ID tokens with scopes. Delegates user login to Kratos or another IdP, enabling SSO and API access across apps and services.                     |
| Enterprise Federation & Single Sign-On (SSO)          | How can enterprise customers sign in with their corporate identity provider?  | **Ory Polis** Provides enterprise SSO by connecting apps to SAML and OIDC identity providers. Bridges legacy SAML into modern OAuth2 flows and supports SCIM directory sync for automated user and group provisioning. |
| Fine-grained Authorization & Permissions              | Can this user perform this action on this specific resource?                  | **Ory Keto** Provides relationship-based, fine-grained authorization for application-level permissions, such as access to documents, projects, or business objects.                                                    |
| Proxy Access Control (Enforcement)                    | Should this request be allowed to reach the API right now?                    | **Ory Oathkeeper** Acts as a proxy-based enforcement layer in front of APIs and services, validating credentials and applying authorization decisions before traffic reaches your application.                         |




## From products to solutions

Each Ory product solves a specific IAM challenge, but most real-world implementations combine several. Below are common 
product combinations that demonstrate Ory's modular approach to building IAM solutions.

### Authentication & access control for your applications (Kratos & Keto) 

Users register and sign in through Kratos, while Keto controls what they can see and do based on roles, relationships, or custom rules. 
Use this combination when your application needs both identity management and fine-grained permissions.

### Authentication & delegated access across apps and services (Kratos & Hydra)

Users authenticate through Kratos, and Hydra issues OAuth2/OIDC tokens that enable single sign-on and let applications act on users' behalf 
with scoped access. Use this combination when you need a shared identity across multiple apps, third-party integrations, or API access.

![Ory Kratos](./_static/kratos-hydra.drawio.svg)

### Authentication, SSO, & fine-grained access control (Kratos, Hydra & Keto)

Combines user authentication, token-based SSO and delegated access, and granular permission checks into a single stack. Use this combination 
when your system needs to manage who users are, which apps can act for them, and exactly what they're allowed to do.

### Enterprise SSO with external identity federation (Polis)

Polis manages federation and communication between your application and third-party identity providers. Use Polis when your customers need to 
authenticate through their own IdP, while session management and user lifecycle remain in your application.

### Authentication, external identity federation, & fine-grained access control  (Kratos, Polis, & Keto)

Users authenticate through Kratos or a federated external IdP via Polis, and Keto enforces what they can access. Use this combination when you 
need both internal identity management and external federation with granular permissions.

### Ory's full IAM stack,  (Kratos, Hydra, Keto, Polis, & Oathkeeper)

The complete Ory ecosystem covers authentication, token issuance, fine-grained permissions, external identity federation, and request-level 
enforcement at the network edge. Use this when you need end-to-end identity and access management for users, apps, APIs, and machine-to-machine 
contexts.
