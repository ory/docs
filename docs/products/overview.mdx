## Which deployment option?

The right option depends on your organization’s goals and how much control you want over your infrastructure. If you need to
maintain full control, meet strict compliance requirements, or operate at massive scale, Ory Enterprise License (OEL) is the best
fit. For teams that want zero infrastructure management and seamless scaling, Ory Network provides a fully managed platform. And
if you’re exploring, testing, or building prototypes, start with Ory Open Source or the Ory Network free tier. All Ory products
share the same open standards and APIs, so you can move between them without rewriting your code.

## Authentication

Kratos — fully standalone. Handles the complete identity lifecycle (registration, login, recovery, MFA, profile management)
without dependencies.

## Authorization

Hydra — needs an identity provider. It's deliberately "headless"—it issues OAuth tokens but doesn't manage users. It asks "who is
this user?" and needs Kratos (or another IdP) to answer.

Keto — needs an identity provider. It answers "can this subject do this action?" but needs something upstream to authenticate who
the subject is.

## Authentication & Authorization

Kratos + Keto — when you need authentication and fine-grained permissions within your own application(s). Users log in via Kratos,
and Keto controls what they can access internally.

Kratos + Hydra — when you need authentication plus OAuth 2.0/OIDC capabilities: SSO across multiple apps, third-party
integrations, or federating identity to external services.

Kratos + Hydra + Keto — when you need all three: user login, token issuance/SSO, and fine-grained permissions.

The choice depends on whether you're solving for internal permissions vs. external/delegated access.
