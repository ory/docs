title: Managed User Interface
---

Ory Cloud provides a managed user interface (UI) by default per Ory Project. The Managed UI gives you the ability to integrate
with Ory Cloud with minimal setup. It also provides all Ory Cloud features through the Managed UI (such as
[Identity Schema Customization](./identity.mdx)).

Setting up the Managed UI doesn't require much configuration as it's enabled by default. The configuration which requires setup
would be redirecting the user back to your application. For more information on how to configure Browser Redirects, please visit
the [Redirects and Flow Completion](./redirects.mdx) page.

You can test the projects' Managed UI using the **Launch Managed UI** option on the Console sidebar.

The Welcome screen allows for easy navigation and testing of the Managed UI's features.

The Managed UI is dynamic. This means enabling certain features (such as Two-Factor Authentication) or changing the
[Identity Schema](./identity.mdx) will update your Ory project's Managed UI with the enabled features.

## Welcome Screen

The Welcome screen is a starting point for developers integrating with the Ory Cloud. Here developers can test their
configurations and confirm the system's behavior without the need to code anything.

Here is an example of the welcome screen showing the current user session.

## Sign Up

You can change the Managed Sign Up screen by creating a custom [Identity Schema](./identity.mdx) - to add more fields or update
the user facing titles.

By adding the following JSON to the project's Identity Schema, you add a trait to the users identity and a field to the Managed
UI.

```json5
{
  agreement: {
    type: 'boolean',
    title: 'Do you accept our terms and conditions?'
  }
}
```
