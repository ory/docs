title: Browser Redirects and Flow Completion
---

This document covers browser redirects for Server Side Applications (NodeJs, PHP, Golang etc.) and how
to configure them. To learn more about the SDK for Single Page Applications, check out the [SDK](./services-api.mdx)
documentation.

## Allow List

Set dynamic redirects using the `?return_to=` query parameter on [Self-Service Flows](./self-service.mdx). For example: a user opens
a sharable link to go to `https://myapp.com/posts`. This URL requires the user
to have an active session and redirects the user back to the login page. To return the
user back to the original URL, append `?return_to=https://myapp.com/posts` when
starting the self-service login flow `initSelfServiceLogin`:

```js
    "request_url": "http://<your-project>.projects.oryapis.com/self-service/login/browser?return_to=...",
```

`return_to` is set when `initSelfServiceLogin` is called in a browser with a
`return_to` URL set. For API clients such as AJAX
[visit this section](#api-clients).

The `allow list` prevents
[Open Redirect Attacks](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Unvalidated_Redirects_and_Forwards_Cheat_Sheet.html)
by just allowing certain domains, or paths on a domain. As in the example below
`https://sub.domain.myapp.com/only/path` needs to match the sub-domain and path. 
Other redirects using `myapp.com` will fail. Redirects
using `https://anotherapp.com` will succeed on any path.

## Redirect Flows

Ory Cloud has a total of six flows, **Login**, **Registration**,
**Verification**, **Recovery**, **Settings** and **Logout** which can be
configured to redirect back to any URL. A common use case would be to redirect
the user to your application home screen after a logout or to a specific URL on
a sub-domain after a settings password update.

On project creation the redirect flows are set to the default
[Managed User Interface](./managed-ui.mdx).

### Login, Registration, and Settings

The Login and Registration flows have three fields (all optional):

1. `Default Redirect URL` domain or path relative to your application URL
2. `Post-Password Redirect URL`
3. `Post-OIDC Redirect URL`

The Settings flow has three fields (all optional):

1. `Default Redirect URL` domain or path relative to your application URL
2. `Post-Password Redirect URL`
3. `Post-Profile Redirect URL`

To overwrite the `Global Redirect URL` set the `Default Redirect URL` to a fully
qualified domain name
([FQDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_qualified_domain_name) - for example
`https://domain.example/login`).  
To replace the `Global Redirect URL` path set the `Default Redirect URL` to a
path. For example when setting it to `/login`,
`https://domain.example/global/path` becomes `https://domain.example/login`.

The `Default Redirect URL` is used when Ory isn't sure where to redirect. Itâ€™s a
good idea for this to be your default app URL, for example `/` or the dashboard.
Use sub-conditions to control where users are redirected after registration,
login, and other self-service flows.

On sub-conditions such as `After Password` or `After Profile` an FQDN or a path
can be set.  
Set the `Post-` redirect to a FQDN to replace the closest relative, starting
with the Login/Registration `Default Redirect URL` and then the
`Global Redirect URL`.  
Set the `Post-` redirect to a path to use the closest relative as the base URL -
as described above with the `Default Redirect URL`.

All the relative URLs will be updated with their respective base URL. As shown
in the example below, the `Post-Login Default Redirect URL` is set to
a path. This means the base URL will be the `Global Redirect URL`
(`https://myapp.com`). This will set the Login `Default Redirect URL` to
`https://myapp.com/after/login` and the `Post-Password` to
`https://myapp.com/after/login/password`.

In the example below , the `Post-Login Default Redirect URL` is set to use
a FQDN. This will set the Login `Default Redirect URL` to
`https://myapp.com/after/login` and the `Post-Password` to
`https://myapp.com/after/login/password`.

### Verification, Recovery, and Logout

:::warning

The `Post-Recovery` redirect isn't supported and will automatically redirect the
user to the `Settings UI` URL.  
Use the `Post-Settings` redirect of `Post-Recovery` flows.

:::

Each of these flows has a single field, the `Default Redirect URL`. As with
Login, Registration, and Settings configurations, the `Default Redirect URL` can
be an FQDN or a path.

## Reset and Update Flows

Update or delete a redirect by either changing the current redirects
value or deleting the entry and clicking the **Update** button. Reset all flows at once with the **Reset Flows** button which will prompt a confirmation
box. Resetting all flows will reset all the fields back to the default value
which is the Ory Cloud [Managed User Interface](./managed-ui.mdx).

Updates to flows will take effect on **new** flows. It will have no effect on old flows that haven't expired yet.

## Troubleshooting

### API Clients

The browser redirects work just for regular browser requests.  
If you are using an API Client for example AJAX, redirect the user to the right
endpoint in the application, for example:

```ts
          .then((res) => {
            router.push('/<your-route>')
          })
```

### Invalid URL

The [allow list](#allow-list) and any of the post-flow redirects require a valid
URL with a scheme (HTTP or HTTPS). An example of a valid URL is
`https://www.google.com`.

### Domain Denied

It's not possible to set the `ory` domain as redirect URL.
