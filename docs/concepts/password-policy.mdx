Password-based authentication flows are subject to frequent abuse through social engineering, password guessing and phishing
attacks.  
The Ory Network implements measures to provide high security for password-based flows. The Ory Password Policy follows standards by
the _National Cyber Security Centre_ ([`NCSC`](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/passwords/updating-your-approach)) and National
Institute of Standards and Technology ([`NIST`](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html)) as well as
[leading](https://www.troyhunt.com/passwords-evolved-authentication-guidance-for-the-modern-era/) security researchers.

### Default Password Policy

- The password must by default at least be 8 characters long and all characters (unicode, ASCII) are allowed.
- The Ory Network makes sure the password isn't similar to the username/email or other credentials.  
  To ensure the password is different, The Ory Network enforces a minimum
  [Levenshtein distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance). It also makes sure no significant strings of the
  credentials are part of the password. For example if an users email is `bob@example.com`, `bob24` would not be a valid password.
- The Ory Network checks all passwords against a database of known leaked passwords through the [`HIBP`](https://haveibeenpwned.com/)
  API.  
  Breached or leaked password detection uses anonymized data.
- The Ory Network doesn't require or prohibit a mixture or repeated characters following to
  [`NIST`](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html) guidelines.

For a more detailed explanation on why this is the default password policy for The Ory Network please visit the
[Security Profiles document](https://www.ory.sh/kratos/docs/next/concepts/security/#password-policy/).

### Custom User Interface

When using your [own user interface](https://www.ory.sh/kratos/docs/next/concepts/ui-user-interface), we recommend the following
password policies to ensure security and good user experience:

- Allows the pasting of credentials in login etc. forms.
- Allow making the password visible through a modal.
- Don't show password hints to unauthenticated users.
- Don't expire passwords.

[Security Profiles document](https://www.ory.sh/kratos/docs/next/concepts/security/#user-interface-guidelines).
