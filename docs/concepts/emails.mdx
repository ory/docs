title: Sending Emails
---

Per default, Ory Cloud has the SMTP email sending configured. Ory Cloud sends Emails from the following address:

```
{project.name} via Ory <no-reply@courier-eu.mg.oryapis.com>
```

To supply your own SMTP server, supply the SMTP configuration key when importing your Ory Kratos to Ory Cloud configuration:

```yaml
courier:
  smtp:
    connection_uri: ...
    from_address: ...
    from_name: ...
```

Please be aware that it's not possible to customize the `from_address` and `from_name` fields without also setting your own E-Mail
sending server (`connection_uri`).
