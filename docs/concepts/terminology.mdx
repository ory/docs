## Ory Network terms

section of the Ory Console.

#### Identity Schema

The JSON Schema that defines an identity in an Ory Network Project.

#### Ory Login Session

A cookie or token that's stored in the users' Browser or API Client. It represents a successful Login Flow and lets the user

A generic identifier for each Ory Network project. It has the format `adjective-name-randomstring` for example:
`suspicious-curran-y23rz7k2t`.

#### Ory Project Public API

The Ory Kratos endpoint for accessing your project's public API, it's composed like so:

#### Ory Project Admin API

## Basics

#### End-User

The person who actually uses a Web-App, SPA, or mobile App that uses Ory Network.

#### Identity

The "who" of the application. This can be an employee, customer, external developer, or a programmatic identity like an IoT
device, application, or another kind of machine actor. Other often used aliases include "user", "account", or "user account".

#### Self-services

Interfaces and flows in Ory Network that allow end-users to consume services without the direct involvement of service employees.
A common example would be when someone signs up for a service without interacting directly to support.

#### Browser Client

End-user side. A browser client refers to the Web browser in the user's machine or mobile device.

#### API Client

End-user side. A browser client refers to the Web browser in the user's machine or mobile device.

#### Web App

A web application is a server-side application that renders HTML; often written in PHP, Java, Go, Express.js, etc... Also called
"server-side browser client", since most of the application logic is performed on the server-side.

#### Single Page Application

A Single Page Application (or SPA) is a web application that dynamically rewrites the current web page with new data; often
written in React, Angular, Next, etc... Also called "client-side browser client", since most of the application logic is performed
in the end-users browser, so on the client-side.

#### Native App

A native application is built for a specific device platform such as iOs, Android, Windows, smartTV, or others. Also called
"client without browser", since the end-user doesn't use a browser directly, all flows go directly through the native app UI.

## Self-Service Flows

#### Registration Flow

The path that a user has to take in order to create an identity at your application.

#### Login Flow

The path that a user has to take in order to authenticate (i.e. prove they're a certain identity) at your application.

#### Recovery Flow

The path that a user has to take in order to recover access to their account, for example through a verified email or other means.
