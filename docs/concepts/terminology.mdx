# Terminology

An overview of the terminology used in The Ory Network documentation.  
If you think a term is missing here, please [let us know](https://github.com/ory/docs/issues/new).

## The Ory Network terms

#### Project

A single deployment of The Ory Network. Each project runs its own copy of the Ory services. Learn more about
[projects](./project.mdx).

#### Project settings

The configuration for each individual Ory Project can be changed in the Ory Project Settings.

#### Ory Console

The graphical user interface that can be used to administer and manage projects. You can access it at
[https://console.ory.sh/](https://console.ory.sh/).

#### Ory SDK URL

The environmental variable `ORY_SDK_URL` specifies where the Ory instance is available. It can be found in the "API & Services"
section of the Ory Console.

#### Identity Schema

The JSON Schema that defines an identity in an The Ory Network Project.

#### Ory Login Session

A cookie or token that's stored in the users' Browser or API Client. It represents a successful Login Flow and lets the user
access the authenticated identity.

#### Ory Project Slug

A generic identifier for each Ory Network project. It has the format `adjective-name-randomstring` for example:
`suspicious-curran-y23rz7k2t`.

## Basics

#### End-User

The person who actually uses a Web-App, SPA, or mobile App that uses The Ory Network.

#### Identity

The "who" of the application. This can be an employee, customer, external developer, or a programmatic identity like an IoT
device, application, or another kind of machine actor. Other often used aliases include "user", "account", or "user account".

#### Self-services

Interfaces and flows in The Ory Network that allow end-users to consume services without the direct involvement of service
employees. A common example would be when someone signs up for a service without interacting directly to support.

#### Browser Client

End-user side. A browser client refers to the Web browser in the user's machine or mobile device.

#### API Client

End-user side. A browser client refers to the Web browser in the user's machine or mobile device.

#### Web App

A web application is a server-side application that renders HTML; often written in PHP, Java, Go, Express.js, etc... Also called
"server-side browser client", since most of the application logic is performed on the server-side.

#### Single Page Application

A Single Page Application (or SPA) is a web application that dynamically rewrites the current web page with new data; often
written in React, Angular, Next, etc... Also called "client-side browser client", since most of the application logic is performed
in the end-users browser, so on the client-side.

#### Native App

A native application is built for a specific device platform such as iOs, Android, Windows, smartTV, or others. Also called
"client without browser", since the end-user doesn't use a browser directly, all flows go directly through the native app UI.

## Self-Service Flows

#### Registration Flow

The path that a user has to take in order to create an identity at your application.

#### Login Flow

The path that a user has to take in order to authenticate (i.e. prove they're a certain identity) at your application.

#### Recovery Flow

The path that a user has to take in order to recover access to their account, for example through a verified email or other means.
