Session caching is an Ory Network feature designed to ensure the lowest possible latency on the critical-path Check Session API,
which includes the `toSession` and `/sessions/whoami` endpoints.

:::tip

Session caching is available for projects on the Business plan or higher. You must enable this feature manually. Read the
[Configuration](#configuration) section to learn how to turn it on.

:::

## Caching strategy

The `/sessions/whoami` endpoint is optimized for maximum performance and low latency when using Ory Session Cookies. To achieve
this, Ory uses a planet-scale network edge cache.

The caching strategy is as follows:

- If the session credentials are unknown, the cache is bypassed.
- If the session credentials are known and cached, the cache is served immediately and refreshed in the background.
- If the session credentials are known and cached, the cache respects the `Cache-Control: max-age=60` header.
- If the user updates their profile or adds another authentication factor, the session is refreshed in the cache automatically.

## Performance

You can expect a P95 latency of ~60ms and a P99 latency of ~70ms across the globe when you use session caching. Results can vary
depending on the geographical proximity to the closest node.

## Impact on business logic

There are some edge cases where session caching can affect your business logic:

- Changes made to sessions or their corresponding identities through the admin API will not be immediately reflected in the
  `/session/whoami` endpoint.

  :::info

  The Check Session APIs are eventually consistent, which means that the changes you make are always reflected in the API, even if
  in some cases this might not be instantaneous.

  :::

- In some scenarios, revoked sessions will not immediately be marked as inactive by the `/session/whoami` endpoint.

## Force refresh

You can force the `/session/whoami` API to bypass the cache and to return a fresh response by setting `Cache-Control: max-age=0`.

:::note

Bypassing the cache significantly increases response latencies. Try to avoid `Cache-Control: max-age=0` and use the cache as much
as possible.

:::

This will always fetch the freshest session data available and can be used in APIs where you need up-to-date data:

```js
import { Configuration, V0alpha2Api } from "@ory/client"

const ory = new V0alpha2Api(new Configuration())

ory.toSession(undefined, undefined, {
  headers: {
    "Cache-Control": "max-age=0",
  },
})
```

The `max-age` defines what the maximum age of the cache can be. If you set it to `10`, the server will reply with a cached
response if the cache is no older than 10 seconds:

```js
ory.toSession(undefined, undefined, {
  headers: {
    "Cache-Control": "max-age=10",
  },
})
```

## Configuration

By default, session caching is turned off for all projects. Follow these steps to turn the feature on:

````mdx-code-block
<Tabs groupId="console-or-cli">
<TabItem value="console" label="Ory Console" default>


To turn on session caching, go to **Customize** â†’ **Advanced Settings** in the
[Ory Console](https://console.ory.sh/projects/current/advanced-settings).

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="cli" label="Ory CLI">

1. Download the Ory Identities config from your project and save it to a file:

    ```shell
    ## List all available projects
    ory list projects

    ## Get config
    ory get identity-config {project-id} --format yaml > identity-config.yaml
    ```

2. Add the configuration for session caching

    ```yaml title="config.yml"
    feature_flags:
      cacheable_sessions: true
    ```

3. Update the Ory Identities configuration using the file you worked with:

    ```shell
    ory update identity-config {project-id} --file identity-config.yaml
    ```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
