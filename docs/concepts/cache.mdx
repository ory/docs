title: Low-Latency Edge Network
sidebar_label: Low-Latency

The Ory Network provides a global edge-network to provide low-latency access to critical-path APIs. These APIs are eventually
consistent, meaning that changes you make might not be immediately reflected in the API.

## Check Session API (`toSession` / `/sessions/whoami`)

The `/sessions/whoami` endpoint has been optimized for maximum performance and low latency when using Ory Session Cookies. We
achieve this with a planet-scale network edge cache. The cache strategy is as follows:

- If the session credentials are unknown, the cache is bypassed;
- If the session credentials are known and cached, the cache is served immediately and refreshed in the background;
- If the session credentials are known and cached, the cache will respect `Cache-Control: max-age=60` headers;
- If the user updates their profile or steps-up their authentication, the session will be refreshed in the cache automatically.

### Performance

You can expect a P95 latency of ~60ms and a P99 latency ~70ms across the globe when the cache is used. Depending on your distance
to our closest node, the latency may vary in your location.

### Caveats

There are some edge cases where caching might affect your business logic:

- Changes made to the session or its identity through the admin API will not be immediately reflected in the `/session/whoami`
  endpoint;
- In some scenarios, revoked sessions will not immediately be marked as inactive by the `/session/whoami` endpoint.

### Force Refresh

You can ask the `/session/whoami` API to return a fresh response by setting `Cache-Control: max-age=0`.

:::note

Bypassing the cache will significantly increase response latencies. Try to avoid `Cache-Control: max-age=0` and use the cache as
much as possible.

:::

This will always fetch the freshest session data available and can be used in APIs where you need up-to-date data:

```js
import { Configuration, V0alpha2Api } from "@ory/client"

const ory = new V0alpha2Api(new Configuration())

ory.toSession(undefined, undefined, {
  headers: {
    "Cache-Control": "max-age=0",
  },
})
```

The `max-age` defines what the maximum age of the cache can be. If you set it to `10`, the server will reply with a cached
response if the cache is no older than 10 seconds:

```js
ory.toSession(undefined, undefined, {
  headers: {
    "Cache-Control": "max-age=10",
  },
})
```
