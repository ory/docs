Ory Cloud exposes APIs to its services to integrate your applications using our SDKs or HTTP Endpoints directly. This makes it
possible for you to integrate your own user interface (UI) in the form of a Web or Native Application.

## SDK Configuration

The SDK URL is the easiest way to integrate your interface with Ory Cloud. It's only a single API endpoint which is used to speak
directly to your Ory project.

## APIs

These endpoints are for integration with individual Ory Cloud services such as [Ory Kratos](https://ory.sh/kratos). Ory Cloud
offers a hosted instance of [Ory Kratos](https://ory.sh/kratos), with [Ory Hydra](https://ory.sh/hydra),
[Ory Keto](https://ory.sh/keto), and more soon to follow.

## Implementation

Please refer to our [guides](../guides/index.mdx) on implementing the SDK as well as the usage of Ory Cloud services.
