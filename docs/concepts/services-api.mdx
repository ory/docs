Ory Cloud exposes APIs to its services to integrate your applications using our
SDKs or HTTP Endpoints directly. This makes it possible for you to integrate
your own user interface (UI) in the form of a Web or Native Application.

## SDK Configuration

The SDK URL is the easiest way to integrate your interface with Ory Cloud. It's
only a single API endpoint which is used to speak directly to your Ory project.
You can read more about the different
[SDKs here](../start-building/other-languages).

## APIs

These endpoints are for integration with individual Ory Cloud services such as
[Ory Kratos](https://ory.sh/kratos). Ory Cloud offers a hosted instance of
[Ory Kratos](https://ory.sh/kratos) with more to follow in the coming months.

For more information on our offering, please refer to our
[roadmap](../cloud/cloud-roadmap.mdx).

## Implementation

Please refer to our [guides](../guides/index.mdx) on implementing the SDK as
well as the usage of Ory Cloud services.
