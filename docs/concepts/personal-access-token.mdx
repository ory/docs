title: Authorization and API Keys
---

Each project has API keys used to perform privileged operations, for example deleting an identity. To create an API Key head over
to the Ory Console [API Key page](https://console.ory.sh/projects/current/connect).

:::tip

You can use API keys to call APIs from the command line or through scripts. Ory API Keys are always prefixed with `ory_apikey_`
(or `ory_pat_`), which makes it easy to identify them when analyzing code.

:::

Passing the API Key is done via the `Authorization` header:

```text
GET /admin/identities HTTP/1.1
Host: {project.slug}.projects.oryapis.com
Accept: application/json
Authorization: Bearer {api-key}
```
