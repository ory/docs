You need to access the Ory administrative APIs if you want to:

- [list](../cli/ory-identities-list.md),
- [update](../cli/ory-identities-get.md) or
- [delete](../cli/ory-identities-delete.md) identities,
- use the [Ory CLI](../start-building/ory-cli-install-use.mdx) to manage your
  project

To access administrative APIs at Ory you need to authenticate as an
administrator. Ory offers Personal Access Tokens to make this process easier for
development. You can use PATs to access the admin API from the command line or
via scripts.

:::note

Ory's Personal Access Tokens are always prefixed with `ory_pat_`, making them
easier to identify in code analysis.

:::

Personal Access Tokens are bound to a project. They do not work for other
projects than the one they have been created for.

Every member can create many, but not unlimited, personal access tokens. When
creating a token you must give it a description to help you remember what you
created the token for. It helps to name the token after the function it performs
or after the person that uses it, but the name can be freely chosen.

The token is only displayed once upon creation. If you lose the token you will
have to create a new one.

To see detailed instructions how to create and use Personal Access Tokens, refer
to the
[Create Personal Access Tokens Guide](../guides/create-personal-access-token.mdx).
