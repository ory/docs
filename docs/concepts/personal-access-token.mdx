A Personal Access Token (PAT) is a means of authentication you can use when directly calling the Ory APIs. The PAT is bound to the
project where it was created. A PAT created for an administrator in project `A` won't be valid in project `B` in any capacity.

For example, when calling Ory administrative APIs to [list](../cli/ory-list-identities.md), [update](../cli/ory-get-identity.md),
or [delete](../cli/ory-delete-identity.md) identities, you must authenticate as an administrator. You can do that by passing a PAT
in the request's `Authorization` header. The PAT must be generated for a user with administrative rights in the project in which
you want to manage identities.

:::tip

You can use PATs to call APIs from the command line or through scripts. Ory PATs are always prefixed with `ory_pat_`, which makes
it easy to identify them when analyzing code.

## Creating a Personal Access Token

Follow these steps to create a Personal Access Token (PAT):

1. Open the [Ory Console](https://console.ory.sh/) and sign in.
2. Select **Connect** from the left navigation bar.
3. Scroll to the bottom of the page to the **Personal Access Token** section.
4. Click the **+** icon.
5. Define the name of the generated token. This name is used for identification purposes only.
6. Copy the created PAT and store it in a safe place.

   :::warning

   The PAT is displayed only once. If you lose the token, you must generate a new one.
