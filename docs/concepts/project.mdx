title: Ory Cloud Project
---

Ory Cloud Projects are isolated tenants providing functionality, user
interfaces, and APIs around identities, sessions, login, and many more.

Internally, Ory Cloud Projects run our popular open source projects in a
multi-tenant environment in a highly scalable, low-latency, and reliable way.
Ory Cloud Projects include additional services (e.g. dashboards, security, SLAs,
...) which are not available in the open source.

For a step-by-step guide please visit the
[Create Ory Cloud Project](../start-building/create-project.mdx) document.

## Project Services

Each Ory Cloud Project consists of the following services :

- Ory Kratos: All IAM and self-service user flows. Learn more about
  [Ory Kratos](https://www.ory.sh/kratos/docs/).

- Ory Proxy: Proxy for the Ory Cloud. Learn more about
  [the Ory Proxy capabilities](https://www.ory.sh/docs/guides/proxy).

- Hosted UI: To be found under "General/Managed UI". Provides clean and
  performant interfaces for all self-service flows without external JS
  dependencies. Comparable with the
  [Ory NodeJS example UI](https://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-node).

- Console: The administrative interface for managing the Ory Cloud, to be found
  under [console.ory.sh](https://console.ory.sh/).

- Backoffice: The API Endpoints to manage the Ory Cloud via CLI or API, to be
  found under `Hosts` in the [Projects Overview](#projects-overview).

- Observability Stack: Provides Metrics, Traces, Logs, and more for maintenance
  and will soon generate helpful insights on your Ory Cloud Project on the
  General Dashboard.

as well as load balancing, and security components. The Ory Cloud Project is
connected to a
[Cockroach database](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/frequently-asked-questions.html#what-is-cockroachdb)
instance.

Coming soon:

- Ory Keto: Permissions for the Ory Cloud Project. Learn more about
  [Ory Keto](https://www.ory.sh/keto/docs/). Currently limited rules are
  available, more advanced settings will be available in self-service
  [soon](../early-access#roadmap).

- Ory Hydra: OAuth2.0 Server capabilities for Ory Cloud Projects. Learn more
  about [Ory Hydra](https://www.ory.sh/hydra/docs/).

## Projects Overview

The Projects Overview displays a list of your active projects with several
parameters that help identify your Ory Cloud Project:

- `Name` is the name you choose when creating the project. It can be changed in
  the [Projects Overview](https://console.ory.sh/projects/list).

- `Slug` is the internal human-readable
  [Clean URL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_URL#Slug) of the Ory Cloud
  Project. It consists of a randomly generated word pair and a random string
  e.g. `nostalgic-jemison-kj2qx2nhkm`. The Slug is part of the project URL:
  `https://nostalgic-jemison-kj2qx2nhkm.projects.oryapis.com`

- `Hosts` are the projects main APIs:
  - the Ory Kratos API Endpoint
    `nostalgic-jemison-kj2qx2nhkm.projects.oryapis.com`
  - and the Public Backoffice API Endpoint
    `nostalgic-jemison-kj2qx2nhkm.projects.console.ory.sh`
