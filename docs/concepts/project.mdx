In Ory Network, projects are isolated tenants providing functionality, user interfaces, and APIs around identities, sessions,
login, and many more.

Internally, projects run our popular open source projects in a multi-tenant environment in a highly scalable, low-latency, and
reliable way. Projects include additional services (such as dashboards, endpoint security, or SLAs) which aren't available in the
open source.

## Project services

Each project in The Ory Network consists of the following services :

- Ory Kratos: all IAM and self-service user flows. Learn more about [Ory Kratos](https://www.ory.sh/kratos/docs/).
- Ory Proxy: proxy for The Ory Network. Learn more about [the Ory Proxy capabilities](https://www.ory.sh/docs/guides/proxy).
- Ory Account Expeience: provides clean and performant interfaces for all self-service flows without external JS dependencies.
  Comparable with the [Ory Node.js example UI](https://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-node).
- Ory Console: the administrative interface for managing The Ory Network, to be found under
  [console.ory.sh](https://console.ory.sh/).
- Backoffice: the API endpoints to manage The Ory Network via CLI or API, to be found under `Hosts` in the
  [Projects Overview](#projects-overview).
- Observability stack: provides metrics, traces, logs, and more for maintenance and will soon generate helpful insights about your
  project on the General Dashboard.

as well as load balancing, and security components. Each project is connected to a
[Cockroach database](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/frequently-asked-questions.html#what-is-cockroachdb) instance.

## Projects overview

The Projects Overview displays a list of your active projects with several parameters that help identify your project:

- `Name` is the name you choose when creating the project. It can be changed in the
  [Projects Overview](https://console.ory.sh/projects/list).
- `Slug` is the internal human-readable [Clean URL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_URL#Slug) of project. It consists of a
  randomly generated word pair and a random string for example `nostalgic-jemison-kj2qx2nhkm`. The Slug is part of the project
  URL: `https://nostalgic-jemison-kj2qx2nhkm.projects.oryapis.com`
- `Hosts` are the projects main APIs:
  - the Ory Kratos API Endpoint `nostalgic-jemison-kj2qx2nhkm.projects.oryapis.com`
  - and the Public Backoffice API Endpoint `nostalgic-jemison-kj2qx2nhkm.projects.console.ory.sh`
