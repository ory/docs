The Ory Network provides headless APIs for ease of integration. This ensures that Ory provides compatibility with many software
stacks across different programming languages.

This documents' focus is specifically on APIs that are used to integrate with Ory's self-service flows. Flows are the fundamental
of Ory's self-service APIs and are used to accomplish a variety of goals, such as `login`, `registration`, `settings`,
`verification` and `recovery`.

The self-service `flows` are standardised so that it follows the same steps regardless of which `flow` is integrated.

Here is an example for `login`:

1. Get or create the login `flow` data
2. Submit the login `flow` with user data (e.g. username and password)

These two steps are the fundamental of all of Ory's self-service `flows`.

Another example for `verification`:

1. Get or create the verification `flow`
2. Submit the verification `flow` with user data (e.g. email)

As shown by the verification `flow` the self-service `flows` have the same two steps regardless of the `flow` type.

## Login flow

Login flows are used to authenticate users. When the login is successful the request will respond with a `200 OK` HTTP status code
and a JSON body containing the user's identity information. When the request fails, it responds with the appropriate HTTP status
and error messages.

### Create Login flow

The flow always has to be initialized before any user data (e.g. username and password) can be submitted. Depending on the type of
application (e.g. browser or native) the initialized flow will set a CSRF cookie and return a CSRF token in the response body. It
is important to take note of the CSRF tokens since it is required when submitting the user data.

### Get Login flow

In cases where the flow already exists we can retrieve the flow data using the flow ID. This is useful in cases where Ory has
already initialized the flow and redirected to the UI. In such a case the flow ID can be extracted from the URL `?flow=` query
parameter.

Depending on the type of application (e.g. browser or native) the initialized flow will set a CSRF cookie and return a CSRF token
in the response body. It is important to take note of the CSRF tokens since it is required when submitting the user data.

Here are some cases where the flow would already exist:

1. Ory has initialized the flow and redirects to the UI (e.g. `/login?flow=<uuidv4>`)
2. The request was completed by the user, however, an error occurred and we need to retrieve the flow data to display the error
3. The UI has 'stored' the flow ID in the URL so that page refreshes can retrieve the flow data

### Submit Login flow

We can submit the login flow with user data (e.g. username and password) using the flow ID. Depending on the type of application
(e.g. browser or native) the CSRF tokens are required in the request body and cookie.

:::note

A session cookie or token can also be prevented on login using additional checks, such as only allowing verified users to login.
For more information, please take a look at
[Customize login and registration](../identities/sign-in/actions#allow-login-only-with-verified-email)

### More Concepts and API References

More conceptual information on the login flow can be found in [Self-service Login Flow](../kratos/self-service/flows/user-login).

For API references, please take a look at the [API Reference](../reference/api) section.

Below are the API references for the login flow.

- [Get Browser Login Flow](../reference/api#tag/frontend/operation/getLoginFlow)
- [Get Native Login Flow](../reference/api#tag/frontend/operation/getLoginFlow)
- [Create Login Flow](../reference/api#tag/frontend/operation/createBrowserLoginFlow)
- [Update Login Flow](../reference/api#tag/frontend/operation/updateLoginFlow)

## Registration flow

Registration flows are used to register users. When the registration is successful the request will respond with a `200 OK` HTTP
status code. When the request fails, it responds with the appropriate HTTP status and error messages.

:::note

Registration data is dependent on the [Identity Schema](../identities/manage-identity-schema) traits. This ensures registration
flows are flexible and can be used for a variety of use cases.
