The Ory Network provides headless APIs for ease of integration. This ensures that Ory provides compatibility with many software
stacks across different programming languages.

This document's focus is specifically on APIs that are used to integrate with Ory's self-service flows. Flows are the fundamental
of Ory's self-service APIs and are used to accomplish a variety of goals, such as `login`, `registration`, `settings`,
`verification` and `recovery`.

The self-service `flows` are standardised so that it follows the same steps regardless of the technology used to integrate with
Ory.

Here is an example for `login`:

1. Get or create the login `flow` data
2. Submit the login `flow` with user data (e.g. username and password)

These two steps are the fundamental of all of Ory's self-service `flows`.

Another example for `verification`:

1. Get or create the verification `flow`
2. Submit the verification `flow` with user data (e.g. email)

As you can see the self-service `flows` have the same two steps regardless of the `flow` type.

## Login flows

Login flows are used to authenticate users. When the login is successful the request will respond with a `200 OK` HTTP status code
and a JSON body containing the user's identity information. On a failed request the response will be a `400 Bad Request` or
`403 Forbidden`.
