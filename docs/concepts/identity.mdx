title: Identity Schema, Custom Fields
---

The Identity Schema is a JSON Schema which describes your identity's (e.g. your
customers / users / ...) fields. In Ory, every identity can have their own
model, allowing you to separate between different customer types, user types
(e.g. employees and customers). For technical information on Identity Schemas,
check out the open source documentation:

- [Identity Schema](https://www.ory.sh/kratos/docs/concepts/identity-schema)
- [Identity Credentials](https://www.ory.sh/kratos/docs/concepts/credentials)

The Identity Schema can either be one of the available presets or a
[customized model](#custom-identity-model).

## Available Presets

Ory Cloud provides three basic Identity Schema Presets.

### Only Username

This preset is useful for applications that do not require email addresses and a
high degree of anonymity.

:::note

This preset disables account verification, account recovery, and account
enumeration defenses! Do not use it in security-sensitive environments.

:::

With this preset, every identity has exactly one trait - the `username` - which
is used as the login identifier:

```json5
// Identity example
{
  id: '6e9d3d30-f93e-4630-901f-c2096953723d',
  traits: {
    username: 'some-username'
  }
}
```

### Only Email

With this preset, identities have exactly one trait, the `email`. It is used as
the login identifier, for email verification, and for account recovery:

```json5
// Identity example
{
  id: '6e9d3d30-f93e-4630-901f-c2096953723d',
  traits: {
    email: 'foo@bar.com'
  }
}
```

### Demo Profile

:::warning

This profile is EXPERIMENTAL and is encouraged to be used only in PoCs and
demos. It will eventually be removed!

:::

The "Demo Profile" preset has - similar to the "Only Email" preset - an email
field and additionally a first name, last name, and a checkbox.

```json5
// Identity example
{
  id: '6e9d3d30-f93e-4630-901f-c2096953723d',
  traits: {
    email: 'foo@bar.com',
    name: {
      first: 'Foo',
      last: 'Bar'
    },
    newsletter: true
  }
}
```

## Custom Identity Schema

Ory gives you the option to add custom fields to your Identity Schema.

You can define new traits for an identity, save the identity as a template and
switch between different Identity Schemas.
