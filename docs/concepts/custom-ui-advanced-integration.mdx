This document gives you a deeper understanding of how to integrate a custom UI with Ory. It is recommended to read the
[Integration Basics](./custom-ui-basic-integration) first.

## Advanced redirects

Most of the time, the application integrating with Ory would have advanced URL redirects. For example, the application might have
a protected page that the user is redirected from to the login page. After the user has logged in, the user should be redirected
back to the page they were on.

To achieve this, the application can pass a `?return_to=<url>` query parameter to the initialize flow endpoint
[`/self-service/<login|registration|settings|verification|recovery|logout>/browser?return_to=https://myapp.com/protected`](../reference/api#tag/frontend).

The `return_to` URL will be used as the redirect URL after the flow has been completed. For example, in the case of a `login` flow
we would redirect after a successful login has been completed.

Here is a breakdown of how the redirect works:

1. Initialize the flow with a `return_to` URL
2. Use the flow data to render the UI.
3. Submit the flow with user data. (e.g. username and password)
4. Assuming the flow was successful, the user will be redirected to the `return_to` URL.

The `return_to` URL will need to be re-initialized with a new flow. This query parameter does not automatically persist across
different flows. For example, if the user has started a `login` flow with the `return_to` URL set and then switches to a
`registration` flow, the `return_to` URL will not be used for the registration flow.

The only case where the `return_to` URL will persist across flows are with a `recovery` flow transitioning into a `settings` flow.

Let's take a look at an example of how this works:

1. Create a `recovery` flow with `return_to`
2. Email is sent with a `link` or `code` method
3. User completes the `recovery` flow by submitting the `code` or clicking the `link`.
4. The user is given a session and redirected through the `settings` flow.
5. The user submits the `settings` flow with an updated password.
6. The user is redirected to the `return_to` URL.

## Refreshing a user session

It is sometimes required to refresh an active user session beyond the global default session lifespan. In such a case the
application implementing the UI can request through the `?refresh=true` query parameter that Ory should refresh the already
existing session [`/self-service/login/browser?refresh=true`](../reference/api#tag/frontend/operation/createBrowserLoginFlow).
This is only applicable to the `login` flow and requires the user to already be logged in.

A common use case would be:

1. User logs in
2. User interacts with the application
3. User is inactive for a period of time
4. The user returns before the global default session lifespan has expired
5. The session is refreshed through a `login` flow with the `?refresh=true` query parameter.

## Two-Factor authentication

Two-Factor authentication (2FA) is a second step to confirming the user's credentials with another credential, such as `TOTP` or
`TouchID`. When creating a login flow, you can specify the `?aal=<level>` query parameter to specify the level of authentication.

In Ory the levels are:

- aal1: Password or OIDC
- aal2: aal1 + TOTP or WebAuthn or Lookup Secrets

In the case of initializing a second factor, the user must already have a valid session cookie. The
[`/sessions/whoami`](../reference/api#tag/frontend/operation/toSession) endpoint will return with an error with an id
`session_aal2_required` if the user is required to complete a second factor. More information on UI error messages can be found on
the [Customize user interface](../kratos/concepts/ui-user-interface) page.

For more information on Multi-factor authentication take a look at the [Multi-factor authentication](../kratos/mfa/overview).

## Passwordless authentication

Passwordless authentication uses WebAuthn to authenticate a user using a hardware key or biometrics (such as faceID).

To enable passwordless authentication, take a look at the [WebAuthn and FIDO2](../kratos/mfa/webauthn-fido-yubikey) document.

In your application we will need to add the WebAuthn javascript to the page.
