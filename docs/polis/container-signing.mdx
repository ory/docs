Ory Polis container images are signed and can be verified using [cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign).

## Fetching public key

You can use [oras](https://oras.land) (or a similar OCI artifacts tool) to fetch the public key or download it from the website
[here](https://boxyhq.com/.well-known/cosign.pub).

```bash
oras pull ghcr.io/boxyhq/cosign.pub:latest
```

## Container verification

> **Note:** This is supported for all versions >=1.6.0

Ory container images are hosted on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/boxyhq/jackson/tags). You can verify it by using the
following command.

```bash
cosign verify --key cosign.pub ory/polis:<version>
```
