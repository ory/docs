# Upgrade guide

## Upgrading to v1.44.0

Please check the note on ESM libraries and dynamic imports issue [here](guides/npm-library.mdx)

## Upgrading to v1.25.0

The `namespace` column length has been increased to 256 characters to support larger values.

This change affects all the instances with `sql` as the db engine. If you are not running manual migration then the namespace
column will be dropped and populated again. It is highly advisable to back up your data before upgrading.

## Upgrading to v1.21.0

Google DSync Connections will be supported on the back of following changes related to Authorization. These will ease the process
of surfacing up the OAuth endpoints for Google SCIM.

1. Removed `DSYNC_GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI`, `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI` env vars for Ory Polis service.
2. Removed `dsync.providers.google.callbackUrl` from npm.
3. Ory Polis npm will take in new options - `dsync.providers.google.authorizePath` and `dsync.providers.google.callbackPath`.
   These will be used alongside `externalUrl` to construct the full path

## Upgrading to v1.14.0

We have changed the schema bit to introduce a new column called `namespace` to speed up scans. You will have to run the migration
scripts if you are manually managing migrations. For example PlanetScale where auto migrations are not supported due to a
difference between MySQL and PlanetScale.

## Upgrading to v1.11.0

We have patched the SSO connection (`/api/v1/connections`) DELETE handler to accept payload (client/Secret or
tenant/product/strategy) as part of query parameters. Earlier, the payload was expected to be part of the body which is
non-standard and is no longer supported in Next.js.

## Upgrading to v1.9.7

We discovered and fixed a database connection leak introduced in v1.9.1, if you are using versions 1.9.1 to 1.9.6 then please
upgrade to v1.9.7

## Upgrading to v1.8.0

1. We support bringing your own database (BYOD), this is a very tricky feature to support and we are still iterating on the schema
   which works as seamlessly as possible across the range of databases we support. Unfortunately, not everything goes smoothly
   here and we have encountered some length issues on newer versions of MySQL and MariaDB. The best way forward was to change the
   schema of the keys we use from length 1500 to 250 which is compatible with the newer versions. As a result, this will break
   your updates if you are using MySQL, MariaDB, or MS SQL Server. If you encounter this please reach out and we'll guide you
   through the update process. If you haven't gone into production yet then please update to v1.8.0 before you deploy it to
   production.

## Upgrading to v1.3.10

1. For users of the Ory Polis npm library, `directorySync` has been renamed to `directorySyncController`.

## Upgrading to v1.3.6

1. `samlSPConfig.get()` is now async since we introduced a global certificate instead of per tenant certificate to ease the SAML
   setup process.

## Upgrading to v1.3.0

1. Landed support for OpenID Identity Providers.
2. Landed new API (`/api/v1/connections`) to support setting up both SAML/OIDC SSO Connections.

> **Note:** The previous API for SAML configuration `/api/v1/saml/config` has been deprecated, and would be completely removed in
> a future release.

3. Renamed env variable `PRE_LOADED_CONFIG` to [`PRE_LOADED_CONNECTION`](deploy/env-variables.mdx#pre_loaded_connection) for Ory
   Polis service. In the case of npm `preLoadedConfig` becomes`preLoadedConnection`.
4. Make sure to set the value for [`oidcPath`](deploy/env-variables.mdx#oidcpath) in case you are using the npm.

## Backups

Please remember to take backups before upgrading Ory Polis. We cannot stress how important this step is, although we take
precautions to avoid bugs they sometimes do slip by us. Having backups will not only help you recover from these rare events but
should be part of your disaster recovery process. If you need any help with this please do not hesitate to reach out to us.
