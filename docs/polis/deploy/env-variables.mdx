# Environment Variables for Enterprise SSO

The env vars are only applicable to the Ory Polis service. If you are using the npm library then look for the options below when
initializing the library.

## General configuration

### **HOSTNAME**

If you need to bind to a specific hostname, you can define `HOSTNAME` environment variable. For example, if you are planning to
use a Docker health check like `wget -q --spider http://localhost:{PORT}/api/health || exit 1` set `HOSTNAME=0.0.0.0` to listen to
localhost.

### **HOST_URL**

The URL to bind to. Default: `localhost`

### **PORT**

The port to bind to. Default: `5225`

### **EXTERNAL_URL**

The public URL to reach this service. This is used internally to construct the callback url at which the SAML/OIDC IdP sends back
the authorization response.

Default: `http://{HOST_URL}:{PORT}`

NPM library option: `externalUrl`

### **ACS_URL**

The custom ACS URL (if used) to let Ory Polis know which ACS URL to send to in the SAML Request to the IdP. Custom ACS URL can
also be defined per SAML connection.

Available from version `1.40.1`.

NPM library option: `acsUrl`

### **JACKSON_API_KEYS**

A comma separated list of API keys that will be validated when serving the API requests (`/api/v1/**`).

For example `JACKSON_API_KEYS=key1,key2,key3`

The API requests will then need to specify an `Authorization` header which contains one of the API keys above in this format:
`Api-Key key1`

### **SAML_AUDIENCE**

The value of this setting (same as SP EntityID of Ory Polis) allows the Ory Polis instance to verify that it is the intended
recipient of a SAML response. The same value is also set in the SAML App created on the IdP end by your customers. Once set do not
change this value unless you get your customers to reconfigure their SAML App again. It is case-sensitive. This does not have to
be a real URL.

Default: `https://saml.ory.sh`

NPM library option: `samlAudience`

### **samlPath**

> **_NOTE:_** This is only applicable to the Ory Polis npm library.

The ACS path at which the [saml response](../guides/npm-library#saml-response) is sent back from the SAML IdP. Set this when using
the npm package.

NPM library option: `samlPath`

For example: `/api/oauth/saml`

### **oidcPath**

> **_NOTE:_** This is only applicable to the Ory Polis npm library.

The `redirect_uri` at which the Authorization response is sent back from the OpenID Connect IdP. Set this when using the npm
package.

NPM library option: `oidcPath`

For example: `/api/oauth/oidc`

### **IDP_DISCOVERY_PATH**

This is the path for showing the IdP Selection screen in case there are multiple SSO Connections for the same `tenant` and
`product`. This path is also used to show the App Selection screen in the case of IdP-initiated SAML login (Different apps using
the same SAML IdP). Set this when using the npm package.

NPM library option: `idpDiscoveryPath`

For example: `/idp/select` - You can find an implementation of IdP/App Selection
[here](https://github.com/ory/polis/blob/main/pages/idp/select.tsx).

### **CLIENT_SECRET_VERIFIER**

When `tenant` and `product` are used for the SAML flow (and PKCE is not being used) then we use `dummy` as placeholders for
`client_id` and `client_secret`. This is not a security issue because SAML is tenanted and hence your Identity Provider will block
access to anyone trying to log into your SAML tenant. However for additional security you should set `CLIENT_SECRET_VERIFIER` to a
random secret and use that value as the `client_secret` during the OAuth 2.0 flow.

Default: `dummy`

NPM library option: `clientSecretVerifier`

### **IDP_ENABLED**

Set to true to enable IdP initiated login for SAML. SP initiated login is the only recommended flow but you might have to support
IdP login at times.

Default: `false`

NPM library option: `idpEnabled`

### **PUBLIC_KEY**

This is the public key of the private key used to sign the SAML requests. Ory Polis expects the public key to be base64 encoded.

NPM library option: `certs.publicKey`

### **PRIVATE_KEY**

This is the private key used to sign the SAML requests. Ory Polis expects the private key to be base64 encoded.

NPM library option: `certs.privateKey`

To generate a private key and public key pair you can use the following command:

```bash
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout key.pem -out public.crt -sha256 -days 365 -nodes

# Convert the public key to base64
cat public.crt | base64

# Convert the private key to base64
cat key.pem | base64
```

### **FLATTEN_RAW_CLAIMS**

Set this config if you want to flatten all the raw claims into the profile instead of grouping them into profile.raw, this is
needed for some OIDC providers that do no support nested objects

Default: `false`

NPM library option: `flattenRawClaims`

## OpenID configuration

For supporting OpenID flow, we need to set the algorithm and keys used to sign the ID token JWT.

### **OPENID_JWS_ALG**

The algorithm used to sign the id_token. Ory Polis uses [jose](https://github.com/panva/jose) to create the ID token. Supported
algorithms can be found [here](https://github.com/panva/jose/issues/114#digital-signatures).

Default: `RS256`

NPM library option: `openid.jwsAlg`

### **OPENID_RSA_PRIVATE_KEY**

Base64 value of private key. To generate one:

```bash
openssl genrsa -out private-key.pem 3072
openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform PEM -outform PEM -nocrypt -in private-key.pem -out private_key.pem
cat private_key.pem | base64
```

NPM library option: `openid.jwtSigningKeys.private`

### **OPENID_RSA_PUBLIC_KEY**

Base64 value of public key. You can generate the public key from the private key as shown below:

```bash
openssl rsa -in private_key.pem -pubout -out public_key.pem
cat public_key.pem | base64
```

NPM library option: `openid.jwtSigningKeys.public`

### **OPENID_REQUEST_PROFILE_SCOPE**

By setting this to `false`, the profile scope will no longer be automatically included in the Authorization request to the OIDC
provider. This will enable apps to request the minimum required authorization permissions from the signed in user. Apps can
explicitly send the profile scope in the request to Ory Polis which will then be forwarded to the OIDC provider.

Default: `true`

NPM library option: `openid.requestProfileScope`

### **OPENID_SUBJECT_PREFIX**

By setting this to `true`, the `id` and `subject` in OIDC claims will be prefixed with `${tenant}:${product}:` to prevent any
potential collisions or malicious IdPs.

Default: `true`

NPM library option: `openid.subjectPrefix`

## Database configuration

### **DB_ENGINE**

Supported values are `redis`, `sql`, `mongo`, `mem`, `planetscale`, `dynamodb`

Default: `sql`

NPM library option: `db.engine`

> **_NOTE:_** If you are using DynamoDB then you also need to set `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`. For additional
> options like region and capacity units check [this section](#db_dynamodb_region)

> **_NOTE:_** `mem` DB (In memory database) is useful to test the Ory Polis setup locally and is not intended for production. In a
> serverless deployment like Vercel, the mem DB won't persist across API calls since each call is a fresh lambda invocation with
> an entirely new context.

### **DB_TYPE**

Only needed when DB_ENGINE is sql. Supported values are `postgres`, `cockroachdb`, `mysql`, `mariadb`, `mssql`

Default: `postgres`

NPM library option: `db.type`

### **DB_URL**

The database URL to connect to. If you are using self-signed certificates then pass `sslmode=no-verify` instead of
`sslmode=require` in the `DB_URL`. This is because self-signed certs will be rejected as unauthorized in strict mode. Also, set
`DB_SSL=true` and `DB_SSL_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=false` (see env vars below for more details).

Example: `postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres` or
`postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres?sslmode=no-verify`

For `mssql` the URL takes the form of
`sqlserver://localhost:1433;database=<db name>;username=<username>;password=<password>;encrypt=true`

> **_NOTE:_** If you are using DynamoDB then you also need to set `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`. For additional
> options like region and capacity units check [this section](#db_dynamodb_region)

NPM library option: `db.url`

### **DB_SSL**

This needs to be set to `true` if you are using SSL with your database (You should definitely be using SSL if the database needs
to be access via a public url).

Default: `false`

### **DB_SSL_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED**

If you are using a self-signed certificate then set this to `false`, otherwise it will be rejected due to Certificate Authority
checks.

Default: `true`

### **DB_MANUAL_MIGRATION**

Set this to true to trigger execution of migration scripts when you use the Ory Polis docker image.

Optionally you can run the npm scripts present in `./npm/package.json` to run db specific migrations.

Make sure you have set the correct value for `DB_ENGINE` environment variable as the migration script checks that to run correct
command and migration file.

NPM library option: `db.manualMigration` Default: `false`

### **DB_TTL**

TTL for the code, session and token stores (in seconds)

Default: `300`

NPM library option: `db.ttl`

### **DB_CLEANUP_LIMIT**

Limit cleanup of TTL entries to this number

Default: `1000`

NPM library option: `db.cleanupLimit`

### **DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY**

To encrypt data at rest specify a 32 byte key (encoded in base64)

You can use openssl to generate a random 32 byte key:

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

NPM library option: `db.encryptionKey`

### **PGSSLMODE**

If you use Heroku to deploy Postgres (or use self-signed certs for Postgres) then set this to `no-verify`. See
[Heroku docs](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/connecting-heroku-postgres#connecting-in-node-js) for more details

### **DB_DYNAMODB_REGION**

If you are using DynamoDB then you can specify the region.

Default: `us-east-1`

NPM library option: `db.dynamodb.region`

### **DB_DYNAMODB_RCUS**

If you are using DynamoDB then you can specify the read capacity units. Check
[AWS docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/HowItWorks.ReadWriteCapacityMode.html) for more
details

Default: 5

NPM library option: `db.dynamodb.readCapacityUnits`

### **DB_DYNAMODB_WCUS**

If you are using DynamoDB then you can specify the write capacity units.

Default: 5

NPM library option: `db.dynamodb.writeCapacityUnits`

## Webhook configuration

### **WEBHOOK_URL**

Specify a webhook URL to receive events about sso and directory connections.

NPM library option: `webhook.endpoint`

### **WEBHOOK_SECRET**

Specify a secret to be used to sign the webhook payload. This is used to verify the authenticity of the webhook payload.

NPM library option: `webhook.secret`

Both the `WEBHOOK_URL` and `WEBHOOK_SECRET` are required to enable webhook events.

## Pre-loaded Connections

### **PRE_LOADED_CONNECTION**

If you only need a single tenant or a handful of pre-configured tenants then this config will help you read and load IdP (both
OpenID and SAML)connections. It works well with the mem DB engine so you don't have to configure any external databases for this
to work (though it works with those as well). This is a path (absolute or relative) to a directory that contains files organized
in the format described in the next section. Check [this section](pre-loaded-connections.mdx) for more details

NPM library option: `preLoadedConnection`

## Opentelemetry configuration

Ory Polis supports observability via OpenTelemetry. The following env vars are available for configuration (along with the rest of
the [supported ones](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/protocol/exporter.md))

### **OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT** or **OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_METRICS_ENDPOINT**

Target URL to which the exporter is going to send metrics.

Example: `https://ingest.lightstep.com:443/metrics/otlp/v0.6`

### **OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS** or **OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_METRICS_HEADERS**

Headers relevant for the endpoint, useful for specifying authentication details for providers.

Example: `lightstep-access-token=<token>,...`

### **OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL** or **OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_METRICS_PROTOCOL**

The transport protocol. Options MUST be one of: `grpc`, `http/protobuf` or `http/json`.

### **OTEL_EXPORTER_DEBUG**

Set this to `true` to enable debug logs for Opentelemetry. This is only meant for purposes of debugging otel locally.

## Admin Portal configuration

Below variables are used to enable [Magic link](https://next-auth.js.org/providers/email) based authentication for Admin Portal.
The **SMTP\_** variables are used for sending email which contain the magic link (one-time use) for sign in.

canonical URL of the site. More details [here](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/options#nextauth_url).

### **NEXTAUTH_SECRET**

Set this to a random string. You can use `openssl rand -base64 32` to get one. This secret is used to encrypt JWT and hash the
email verification token. More details [here](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/options#nextauth_secret).

### **NEXTAUTH_ACL**

Set this to a comma separated string of email addresses or glob patterns like: `tonystark@gmail.com,*@marvel.com`. Access will be
denied to email addresses which don't match. If you don't specify any value access is denied to all.

### **NEXTAUTH_ADMIN_CREDENTIALS**

Set this to a comma separated string of the pattern `email:password` to enable login to the Admin Portal, for example
`NEXTAUTH_ADMIN_CREDENTIALS=deepak@ory.sh:Password123`. If you don't specify any value access is denied to all.

### **ADMIN_PORTAL_HIDE_AUDIT_LOGS**

Set this to `true` if you want to hide the Audit Logs product in the sidebar.

Default: `false`

### **ADMIN_PORTAL_HIDE_IDENTITY_FEDERATION**

Set this to `true` if you want to hide the Identity Federation product in the sidebar.

Default: `false`

### **ADMIN_PORTAL_SSO_TENANT**

This will be used as the tenant for the SSO connections (added from Settings tab) used to login into the Admin portal itself. Set
this to a value that is less likely to conflict with the main Enterprise SSO connections.

Default: `_polis_boxyhq`

### **ADMIN_PORTAL_SSO_PRODUCT**

`DSYNC_GOOGLE_` env vars are only applicable if you are using Google Workspace as a directory sync provider.

### **DSYNC_WEBHOOK_BATCH_SIZE**

Enable batch processing of directory sync events. The value represents the number of events to batch together instead of sending
each event individually. This requires you to configure a cron job to
[process the queued events](../directory-sync/api-reference.mdx#batch-processing-events). Alternatively you can set
`DSYNC_WEBHOOK_BATCH_CRON_INTERVAL` below if you are not deploying the service in an Edge environment.
