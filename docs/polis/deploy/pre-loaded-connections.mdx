# Pre-loaded SSO Connections

#### SAML

If PRE_LOADED_CONNECTION is set then it should point to a directory with the following structure (example below):-

```bash
example.js
example.xml
anothertenant.js
anothertenant.xml
```

The JS file has the following structure:-

```javascript
module.exports = {
  defaultRedirectUrl: "http://localhost:3366/login/saml",
  redirectUrl: '["http://localhost:3366/*"]',
  tenant: "example.com",
  product: "demo",
  name: "testConnection",
  description: "Just a test connection",
}
```

The XML file (which should have the same name as the .js file) is the raw XML metadata file you receive from your Identity
Provider. Please ensure it is saved in the `utf-8` encoding.

The config and XML above correspond to the [Add connection API - SAML tab](../sso-flow/index.mdx).

#### OIDC

For a connection backed by OpenID IdP create the \*.js file at PRE_LOADED_CONNECTION as shown below:-

See [Add connection API - OIDC tab](../sso-flow/index.mdx)

```javascript
module.exports = {
  defaultRedirectUrl: "http://localhost:3366/sso/oauth/oidc",
  redirectUrl: '["http://localhost:3366"]',
  tenant: "oidc.example.com",
  product: "crm",
  name: "OIDC connection for oidc.example.com",
  description: "OIDC connection for oidc.example.com",
  oidcDiscoveryUrl: "https://accounts.google.com/.well-known/openid-configuration",
  oidcClientId: "<ClientId from the OpenID IdP>",
  oidcClientSecret: "<ClientSecret from the OpenID IdP>",
}
```
