# Vercel

This guide will walk you through the configuration and deployment of Ory Polis on Vercel. We'll be using the Vercel **Deploy
Button** that enables users to deploy apps to Vercel without leaving the web browser and with little or no configuration.

If you donâ€™t have a Vercel account, create one [here](https://vercel.com/signup).

## Deploy Ory Polis

- Fork the the Ory Polis [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ory/polis/fork).
- Go to the forked repo and click the **Deploy** button from the README section.
- Select your username under **GIT SCOPE**.
- Enter a **name** for your project, choose whether you want your repo `private` or `public`, and click **Create**.
- Fill the **Environment Variables** as per the [documentation](../../deploy/env-variables.mdx).
- After you've filled everything click the **Deploy** button.

### Verify deployment

You can visit the path `/api/hello` on your app to see if Ory Polis was started. If the installation was successful, you'll see
the following output on the screen.

```javascript
{
  name: "Jules Winnfield"
}
```

## Next steps

At this stage you have a functional Ory Polis instance running on your server.
