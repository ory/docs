# Heroku

This guide will walk you through the configuration and deployment of Ory Polis on Heroku. We'll be using the **Deploy to Heroku**
button that enables users to deploy apps to Heroku without leaving the web browser and with little or no configuration.

If you donâ€™t have a Heroku account, create one [here](https://signup.heroku.com/).

## Deploy Ory Polis

- Fork the the Ory Polis [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ory/polis/fork).
- Go to the forked repo and click the **Deploy to Heroku** button from the README section.
- Give your new application a **name**.
- Fill the **Config Vars** as per the [documentation](../../deploy/env-variables).
- After you've filled everything click the **Deploy app** button.

### Verify deployment

You can visit the path `/api/hello` on your app to see if Ory Polis was started. If the installation was successful, you'll see
the following output on the screen.

```javascript
{
  name: "Jules Winnfield"
}
```

## Next steps

At this stage you have a functional Ory Polis instance running on your server.
