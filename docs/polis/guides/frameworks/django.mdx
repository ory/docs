# Add SAML SSO to Django App

This guide assumes that you have a Django app and want to enable SAML Single Sign-On authentication for your enterprise customers.
By the end of this guide, you'll have an app that allows you to authenticate the users using SAML Single Sign-On.

Visit the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ory/polis-examples/tree/main/apps/adonisjs) to see the source code for the Django
SAML SSO integration.

Integrating SAML SSO into an app involves the following steps.

- Configure SAML Single Sign-On
- Authenticate with SAML Single Sign-On

## Configure SAML Single Sign-On

This step allows your tenants to configure SAML connections for their users. Read the following guides to understand more about
this.

- [UI Best Practices for Configuring SAML Single Sign-On](../configuring-saml-sso.mdx)
- [SSO Connection API](../../sso-flow/index.mdx)
