## FAQ

#### Why don't I see a DELETE event for a user that was removed in Okta?

Instead of executing a DELETE operation, Okta sends a request to the SCIM application to set the `active` attribute to `false`.
Consequently, you will observe a `user.updated` event with the `active` attribute changed to `false` for users removed from the
Okta application.

#### Why is there no event for a user that was deactivated in Okta?

Okta does not dispatch a specific deprovisioning event for users that are suspended. This omission of a deactivation event is a
known issue with Okta.
