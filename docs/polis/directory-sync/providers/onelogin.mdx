## FAQ

### Why don't I see any event when a group is removed in OneLogin?

It is a known issue with OneLogin SCIM. OneLogin does not dispatch a specific deprovisioning event for groups that are deleted, so
you won't see any event such as `group.deleted` or `group.user_removed` when a group is removed. It is recommended to remove the
users from the group before deleting the group itself from the SCIM application.
