Directory sync helps organizations automate the provisioning and de-provisioning of their users. It is based on the System for
Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) protocol.

As a result, it streamlines the user lifecycle management process by saving valuable organizational hours, creating a single truth
source of the user identity data, and facilitating them to keep the data secure.

Directory Sync is part of the Ory Polis service (and npm library) from v1.2.1 onwards. Follow the instructions in
[Ory Polis](../quickstart.mdx) for details on deployment. Or check out Ory Polis on
[GitHub](https://github.com/ory/polis#directory-sync).

We currently only support SCIM 2.0 protocol because SCIM 1.1 is deprecated and support will be discontinued on December 2nd, 2022.
If you still need support for SCIM 1.1 and are unable to move away from it then please contact us.
