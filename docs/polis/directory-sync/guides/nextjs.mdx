# Next.js

This guide will teach you to implement SCIM Provisioning in your Next.js app.

## Quickstart

Directory sync helps organizations automate the provisioning and de-provisioning of their users in the Enterprise SaaS app. As a
result, it streamlines the user lifecycle management process by saving valuable organizational hours, creating a single truth
source of the user identity data.

### Install Ory Polis

Letâ€™s start by installing Ory Polis to your Next.js app.

```bash
npm i --save @boxyhq/saml-jackson
```

### Initialize Ory Polis

Create a new file, `jackson.ts` that holds the Ory Polis initialization.

```javascript title="lib/jackson.ts"
import type { JacksonOption, IDirectorySyncController } from '@boxyhq/saml-jackson';
import jackson from '@boxyhq/saml-jackson';

let directorySyncController: IDirectorySyncController;

const g = global as any;

const opts = {
  externalUrl: `http://localhost:3000/`,
  samlPath: '/',
  scimPath: '/api/scim',
  db: {
    engine: 'sql',
    type: 'postgres',
    url: "postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/your-database-name",
  },
} as JacksonOption;

export default async function init() {
  if (!g.directorySyncController) {
    const ret = await jackson(opts);

    directorySyncController = ret.directorySyncController;
    g.directorySyncController = directorySyncController;
  } else {
    directorySyncController = g.directorySyncController;
  }

  return {
    directorySyncController,
  };
}
```

### Create the Directory

The first step towards the integration is creating a directory for a tenant.

Directory Sync providers (Identity Providers) require you to provide a **SCIM Base URL** and **SCIM Auth token**. Both are unique
for each directory your app users create.

```javascript
const { data, error } = await directorySyncController.directories.create({
  name: 'any-name',
  type: 'okta-scim-v2',
  tenant: "tenant-identifier"
  product: "product-identifier"
});
```

The response will looks like as below:

```javascript
{
  "data": {
    "id": "58b5cd9dfaa39d47eb8f5f88631f9a629a232016",
    "name": "any-name",
    "tenant": "tenant-identifier",
    "product": "product-identifier",
    "type": "okta-scim-v2",
    "log_webhook_events": false,
    "scim": {
      "path": "/api/scim/58b5cd9dfaa39d47eb8f5f88631f9a629a232016",
      "secret": "IJzAoevjD_liiiy-VkDtXg",
      "endpoint": "http://localhost:5225/api/scim/58b5cd9dfaa39d47eb8f5f88631f9a629a232016"
    },
    "webhook": {
      "endpoint": "",
      "secret": ""
    }
  },
  "error": null
}
```

Note the keys `scim.endpoint` and `scim.secret` from the above JSON. Your users need these values while configuring SCIM app on
their Identity Provider.

Typically you'll have to provide some UI where the users can create the directory for their providers and display `SCIM Base URL`
and `SCIM Auth Token` for the directory the user created. Usually, this UI comes under organization settings or team settings.

You can retrieve the supported list of Directory Sync providers by calling the method `directorySyncController.providers()`.

### Understand SCIM API Requests

A key piece to implementing SCIM is building a RESTful API that IdP's SCIM provisioning can call to provision users and groups to
your app. The requests will come to the `SCIM Base URL (scim.endpoint)`.

Here are the calls your API should be able to receive from IdP SCIM provisioning for a given `SCIM Base URL (scim.endpoint)`.

#### Users Provisioning

| Route      | Methods    |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| /Users     | POST       |
| /Users/:id | GET        |
| /Users/:id | PUT, PATCH |
| /Users/:id | DELETE     |

#### Push Groups and Group Memberships

| Route       | Methods    |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| /Groups     | POST       |
| /Groups/:id | GET        |
| /Groups/:id | PUT, PATCH |
| /Groups/:id | DELETE     |

### Handle SCIM API Requests

Now let's add the route to handle the incoming requests from the Directory Sync providers.

```javascript title="pages/api/scim/[...directory].ts"
import type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next';
import type { DirectorySyncRequest, HTTPMethod, DirectorySyncEvent } from '@boxyhq/saml-jackson';

import jackson from '../../../lib/jackson';

export default async function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {
  const { directorySyncController } = await jackson();

  const { method, query, body } = req;

  const directory = query.directory as string[];
  const [directoryId, path, resourceId] = directory; // Extract the params

  // Construct the event
  const request: DirectorySyncRequest = {
    method: method as HTTPMethod,
    body: body ? JSON.parse(body) : undefined,
    directoryId: directoryId,
    resourceId: resourceId,
    resourceType: path === 'Users' ? 'users' : 'groups',
    apiSecret: extractAuthToken(req),
    query: {
      count: req.query.count ? parseInt(req.query.count as string) : undefined,
      startIndex: req.query.startIndex ? parseInt(req.query.startIndex as string) : undefined,
      filter: req.query.filter as string,
    },
  };

  // Handle the requests
  // highlight-start
  const { status, data } = await directorySyncController.requests.handle(request, async (event: DirectorySyncEvent) => {
    console.log(event); // Do something with the event
  });
  // highlight-end

  // Send the response back
  return res.status(status).json(data);
}

// Fetch the auth token from the request headers
const extractAuthToken = (req: NextApiRequest): string | null => {
  const authHeader = req.headers.authorization || null;

  return authHeader ? authHeader.split(' ')[1] : null;
};
```

`pages/api/scim/[...directory].ts` is a catch all paths route. Matched parameters will be sent as a query parameter to the page,
and it will always be an array.

Look at the highlighted lines, and you can pass an async callback method to the `directorySyncController.requests.handle` as a
second argument. This method will be called with SCIM event as the first argument.

Visit the documentation for [SCIM events and Types](../events.mdx) to understand more about the events.

Use these events to trigger actions in your application, such as creating a new user in your application, or updating a user in
your application based on the changes made in the directory.

### Configure the Identity Provider

Your users should typically do this step at their end. Visit the [documentation](../../directory-sync/providers/) for each
Directory Sync provider to learn more.
