There are two ways to integrate the Directory Sync within your application:

- As a separate service
  - This is available for all frameworks and languages.
  - The advantage of running a separate service is that you get all of the UI tooling such as the Admin Portal to handle the SSO
    and Directory Sync connections with the service.
  - The disadvantage is that you have to manage the operations of a separate service.

Read more about [how to run the Ory Polis service](../quickstart.mdx)

As a service Ory Polis uses webhooks to notify your application any time changes are made to directory users and groups. You can
use webhooks to trigger actions in your application, such as creating a new user in your application, or updating a user in your
application based on the changes made in the directory.

- As an NPM library
  - This is available only if you are developing your application using Node.js.
  - The advantage of embedding Ory Polis as an npm library is that you do not have to manage the operations of a separate service.
  - The disadvantage is that you do not get the UI tooling such as the Admin Portal with this method.

For the NPM quickstart head over to the [NPM quickstart](../guides/npm-library.mdx) documentation.

```bash
npm i --save @boxyhq/saml-jackson
```

See the [API Reference](api-reference.mdx) to understand more about the available methods.
