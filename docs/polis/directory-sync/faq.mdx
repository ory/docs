# Frequently asked questions

Frequently asked questions about the common issues and limitations of the directory sync providers.

### Why don't I see any event when a group is removed in OneLogin?

It is a known issue with OneLogin SCIM. OneLogin does not dispatch a specific deprovisioning event for groups that are deleted, so
you won't see any event such as `group.deleted` or `group.user_removed` when a group is removed. It is recommended to remove the
users from the group before deleting the group itself from the SCIM application.

### Why don't I see a DELETE event for a user that was removed in Okta?

Instead of executing a DELETE operation, Okta sends a request to the SCIM application to set the `active` attribute to `false`.
Consequently, you will observe a `user.updated` event with the `active` attribute changed to `false` for users removed from the
Okta application. [Read More](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/scim/scim-20/#delete-users)

### Why is there no event for a user that was deactivated in Okta?

Okta does not dispatch a specific deprovisioning event for users that are suspended. This omission of a deactivation event is a
known issue with Okta.

### Does Google Workspace sync in real time?

No, Google Workspace sync is not real-time. Ory Polis syncs the Google Workspace directory on a schedule (e.g. every 2 hours). In
a self-hosted deployment, you can configure a cron job to sync the directory on a schedule of your choice.

### Can I sync specific groups from Google Workspace?

Not possible at the moment. Ory Polis syncs all the groups from Google Workspace. You have to filter the groups from your
application's side.

### How frequently does Microsoft Entra ID SCIM perform sync by default?

Microsoft Entra ID automatically provisions and updates user accounts in an app based on things like user and group assignment.
The sync happens at a regularly scheduled time interval, typically every 20-40 minutes.

### Why does the PATCH request fail in Microsoft Entra ID SCIM?

This is a known issue with Entra ID SCIM implementation. You have to add the query param `?aadOptscim062020` to the SCIM endpoint
URL to make PATCH requests work. This query param update PATCH behavior and ensure SCIM compliance.
