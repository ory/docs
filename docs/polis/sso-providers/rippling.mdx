# Rippling SAML SSO

This section will show you how to set up your own custom SAML application for Rippling SAML.

## Create application

You'll need to create a new **Custom App** from your Rippling account if the app is not already in the Rippling app directory.

Go to **IT Management** > **Custom App** from the left navigation menu.

![Rippling SAML Step 1](../_assets/sso-providers/rippling/1.png)

Click **Create New App** button to create a new application.

From the next screen, fill in the following fields:

- **App Name**
- **Select Categories**
- **Upload Logo**
- **What type of app would you like to create?** - Make sure you select **Single Sign-On (SAML)** from the list.

## Configure application

Copy the **IdP Metadata URL** or **IdP Metadata XML** from the next screen. You'll need this value to configure your SAML
connection in Ory Polis.

![Rippling SAML Step 3](../_assets/sso-providers/rippling/3.png)

You'll need to enter the **ACS URL** and **Entity ID**. You'll get these values from Ory Polis.

![Rippling SAML Step 4](../_assets/sso-providers/rippling/4.png)

Make sure that **Service Provider Entity ID** matches the **SAML Audience (SP Entity ID)** value from Ory Polis.

From the **Settings** tab of custom app you just created. Go to **Advanced SAML Settings** section and check the box for **Disable
InResponseTo field in assertions for IdP initiated SSO**.

This is because Rippling sends dummy values for the **InResponseTo** field and Ory Polis will try to validate the **InResponseTo**
field if it is present.

## Next steps

You've successfully configured your custom SAML application for Rippling SAML. At this stage, you can assign users to your
application and start using it.
