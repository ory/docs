Ory Polis takes a multi-tenanted approach to implementing SSO, abstracting away all the complexities of the underlying SAML/OIDC
protocol. What this means is you can enable SSO for all your customers across products from a single instance of Ory Polis, and
works with both SAML and OIDC Identity Providers (IdPs).

> Note: All the APIs below support both `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` and `application/json` content types. Examples below
> use `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.

> Note: OAuth 2.0 protocol uses underscore casing for the parameters, we use camel casing for all Ory Polis APIs. For example it's
> `client_id` in the OAuth 2.0 flow and `clientID` in Ory Polis APIs.

## Set up SSO provider

Please follow the instructions [here](../sso-providers/index.mdx) to guide your customers in setting up SAML/OIDC correctly for
your product(s). You should create a copy of the doc and modify it with your custom settings, we have used the values that work
for Ory Polis demo apps.

## SSO Connection API

You will need to provide a place in the UI for your customers (The account settings page is usually a good place for this) to
configure this and then call the APIs below.

### Add connection

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="saml" label="SAML" default>

Once your customer has set up the SAML app on their Identity Provider, the Identity Provider will generate an IdP or SP metadata
file. Some Identity Providers only generate an IdP metadata file but it usually works for the SP login flow as well. It is an XML
file that contains various attributes Ory Polis needs to validate incoming SAML login requests. This step is the equivalent of
setting an OAuth 2.0 app and generating a client ID and client secret that will be used in the login flow.

The following API call sets up the connection in Ory Polis:

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:5225/api/v1/connections' \
--header 'Authorization: Api-Key <Ory Polis API Key>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
--data-urlencode 'encodedRawMetadata=Base64(<IdP/SP metadata XML>)' \
--data-urlencode 'defaultRedirectUrl=http://localhost:3366/login/saml' \
--data-urlencode 'redirectUrl=http://localhost:3366/*' \
--data-urlencode 'redirectUrl=http://localhost:3000/*' \
--data-urlencode 'tenant=ory.sh' \
--data-urlencode 'product=demo' \
--data-urlencode 'name=demo-connection' \
--data-urlencode 'description=Demo SAML connection'
```

- `metadataUrl`: URL containing the SAML metadata contents. Either this or `encodedRawMetadata` needs to be specified
- `encodedRawMetadata`: Base64 encoding of the XML metadata your customer gets from their Identity Provider. Either this or
  `metadataUrl` needs to be specified
- `defaultRedirectUrl`: The redirect URL to use in the IdP login flow. Ory Polis will call this URL after completing an IdP login
  flow
- `redirectUrl`: Allowed redirect URL. Repeat this field multiple times to allow multiple redirect URLs. Ory Polis will disallow
  any redirects not on this list (or not the default URL above).
- `tenant`: Ory Polis supports a multi-tenant architecture, this is a unique identifier you set from your side that relates back
  to your customer's tenant. This is normally an email, domain, an account id, or user-id. Should not contain the : character
  since we use it as a delimiter internally
- `product`: Ory Polis support multiple products, this is a unique identifier you set from your side that relates back to the
  product your customer is using. Should not contain the : character since we use it as a delimiter internally
- `name`: A friendly name to identify the SAML connection
- `description`: A short description with some information of the connection

The response returns a JSON with `clientID` and `clientSecret` that can be stored against your tenant and product for a more
secure OAuth 2.0 flow. If you do not want to store the `clientID` and `clientSecret` you can alternatively use
`client_id=tenant=<tenantID>&product=<productID>` and use `dummy` (or the value you set for the
[secret verifier](../deploy/env-variables.mdx#client_secret_verifier) env) as the value for `client_secret` when setting up the
OAuth 2.0 flow. Additionally a `idpMetadata.provider` attribute is also returned which indicates the domain of your Identity
Provider.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="oidc" label="OIDC">

Once your customer has set up the [OIDC app](../sso-providers/generic-oidc.mdx) on their Identity Provider, the Identity Provider
will generate a clientId and clientSecret.

The following API call sets up the connection in Ory Polis:

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:5225/api/v1/connections' \
--header 'Authorization: Api-Key <Ory Polis API Key>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
--data-urlencode 'defaultRedirectUrl=http://localhost:3366/login/oidc' \
--data-urlencode 'oidcDiscoveryUrl=<well-known url of OIDC Provider>' \
--data-urlencode 'oidcClientId=<clientId of IdP Registered App>' \
--data-urlencode 'oidcClientSecret=<clientSecret of IdP Registered App>' \
--data-urlencode 'redirectUrl=http://localhost:3366/*' \
--data-urlencode 'redirectUrl=http://localhost:3000/*' \
--data-urlencode 'tenant=ory.sh' \
--data-urlencode 'product=demo' \
--data-urlencode 'name=demo-connection' \
--data-urlencode 'description=Demo OIDC connection'
```

- `oidcDiscoveryUrl`: OpenID Providers supporting discovery make the metadata available at the endpoint obtained by concatenating
  issuer and `/.well-known/openid-configuration`
- `oidcClientId`: The client identifier issued to the client during the IdP registration process.
- `oidcClientSecret`: The client secret issued to the client during the IdP registration process.
- `defaultRedirectUrl`: The redirect URL to use in the IdP login flow. Ory Polis will call this URL after completing an IdP login
  flow
- `redirectUrl`: Allowed redirect URL. Repeat this field multiple times to allow multiple redirect URLs. Ory Polis will disallow
  any redirects not on this list (or not the default URL above).
- `tenant`: Ory Polis supports a multi-tenant architecture, this is a unique identifier you set from your side that relates back
  to your customer's tenant. This is normally an email, domain, an account id, or user-id. Should not contain the : character
  since we use it as a delimiter internally
- `product`: Ory Polis support multiple products, this is a unique identifier you set from your side that relates back to the
  product your customer is using. Should not contain the : character since we use it as a delimiter internally
- `name`: A friendly name to identify the OIDC connection
- `description`: A short description with some information of the connection

The response returns a JSON with `clientID` and `clientSecret` that can be stored against your tenant and product for a more
secure OAuth 2.0 flow. If you do not want to store the `clientID` and `clientSecret` you can alternatively use
`client_id=tenant=<tenantID>&product=<productID>` and use `dummy` (or the value you set for the
[secret verifier](../deploy/env-variables.mdx#client_secret_verifier) env) as the value for `client_secret` when setting up the
OAuth 2.0 flow. Additionally a `idpMetadata.provider` attribute is also returned which indicates the domain of your Identity
Provider.

## OAuth 2.0 flow

:::info

#### OpenID Connect flow

Ory Polis also supports the [OIDC flow](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html). By including `openid` in the
`scope` param, an additional `id_token` is returned from the token endpoint which contains the user claims:
`id, email, firstName, and lastName`. To enable the flow on Ory Polis, be sure to configure the keys and algorithm in
[OpenID configuration](../deploy/env-variables.mdx#openid-configuration). If the authentication request contained `nonce` then it
is passed unmodified to the ID Token, which the client can use to validate and mitigate replay attacks.

:::

Ory Polis has been designed to abstract the underlying SAML/OIDC login flow as a pure OAuth 2.0 flow. This means it's compatible
with any standard OAuth 2.0 library out there, both client-side and server-side. It is important to remember that SSO Connection
is configured per customer unlike OAuth 2.0 where you can have a single OAuth app supporting logins for all customers.

Ory Polis also supports the [PKCE authorization flow](https://oauth.net/2/pkce/), so you can protect your SPAs.

If for any reason you need to implement the flow on your own, the steps are outlined below:

### Authorize

The OAuth flow begins with redirecting your user to the `authorize` URL:

```bash
https://localhost:5225/api/oauth/authorize
  ?response_type=code&provider=saml
  &client_id=<clientID or tenant and product query params as described in the SSO connection API section above>
  &redirect_uri=<redirect URL>
  &state=<randomly generated state id>
```

- `response_type`: `code` is the only supported type for now but maybe extended in the future
- `client_id`: Use the client_id returned by the SSO connection API or use `tenant=<tenantID>&product=<productID>` to use the
  tenant and product IDs instead. Note: Please don't forget to URL encode the query parameters including `client_id`.
- `tenant`: Optionally you can provide use `dummy` as the value for `client_id` and specify the `tenant` and `product` custom
  attributes (if your OAuth 2.0 library allows it).
- `product`: Should be specified if specifying `tenant` above
- `idp_hint`: Can be used to select the Identity Provider if multiple connections match for the same `tenant/product`. Should
  point to the absolute "clientID" of the SSO Connection in Ory Polis.
- `redirect_uri`: This is where the user will be taken back once the authorization flow is complete
- `state`: Use a randomly generated string as the state, this will be echoed back as a query parameter when taking the user back
  to the `redirect_uri` above. You should validate the state to prevent XSRF attacks.
- `nonce` (for OIDC flow): String value used to associate a Client session with an ID Token, and to mitigate replay attacks. The
  value is passed through unmodified from the Authentication Request to the ID Token. Sufficient entropy MUST be present in the
  nonce values used to prevent attackers from guessing values.
- `forceAuthn` (for SAML SSO Connections): If passed in with the value `true`, the outgoing SAML request to IdP will have the
  param `ForceAuthn` set as true forcing the user to re-authenticate even if they have an active session.
- `login_hint` (Relevant for OIDC IdPs like Google): If passed in, the parameter will be forwarded in the OIDC IdP authorize
  request. The IdP can use this value (normally an account identifier such as an email address) as a hint to skip the account
  selection page.

> NOTE: You can also pass the encoded tenant/product in either `scope` or `access_type` or `resource` (Set `client_id` as
> `dummy`). This will come in handy for some setups where the client_id can't be set dynamically.

The user will be taken to the IdP based on the configured SAML/OIDC metadata. In case of any errors, we return the `error`,
`error_description` and `state` (from original request) (see
[Error Response](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/authorization/the-authorization-response/)) back to the `redirect_uri`
(`redirect_uri` is validated against the saml connection to prevent open redirects).

### Code exchange

Once the user logs in successfully at the IdP, IdP sends back the SAML/OIDC response to Ory Polis. For SAML, the response contains
the user profile. In the case of OIDC, the response contains the authorization code that is used by Ory Polis to obtain token and
userprofile from the OIDC IdP. Ory Polis generates a short lived `code` and stores the user profile against it. After successful
authorization, the user is redirected back to the `redirect_uri`. The query parameters will include the `code` and `state`
parameters. You should validate that the state matches the one you sent in the `authorize` request.

The code can then be exchanged for a token by making the following request:

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url 'http://localhost:5225/api/oauth/token' \
  --header 'content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  --data 'grant_type=authorization_code' \
  --data 'client_id=<clientID or tenant and product query params as described in the SAML connection API section above>' \
  --data 'client_secret=<clientSecret or clientSecretVerifier if set (which otherwise defaults to "dummy")' \
  --data 'redirect_uri=<redirect URL>' \
  --data 'code=<code from the query parameter above>'
```

- `grant_type`: `authorization_code` is the only supported flow, for now. We might extend this in the future
- `client_id`: Use the clientID returned by the SSO connection API or use `tenant=<tenantID>&product=<productID>` to use the
  tenant and product IDs instead. Note: Please don't forget to URL encode the query parameters including `client_id`.
- `client_secret`: Use the clientSecret returned by the SAML connection API or clientSecretVerifier (which defaults to "dummy") if
  using the tenant and product in the clientID
- `redirect_uri`: This is where the user will be taken back once the authorization flow is complete. Use the same redirect_uri as
  the previous request

If everything goes well you should receive a JSON response that includes the access token. This token is needed for the next step
where we fetch the user profile.

```json
{
  "access_token": <access token>,
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "expires_in": 300
}
```

### Profile request

The short-lived access token can now be used to request the user's profile. You'll need to make the following request:

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://localhost:5225/api/oauth/userinfo' \
  --header 'authorization: Bearer <access token>'
```

If everything goes well you should receive a JSON response with the user's profile:

```json
{
  "id": <id from the Identity Provider>,
  "email": f@example.com",
  "firstName": "SAML",
  "lastName": "Ory Polis"
  "raw": {
    ...
  },
  "requested": {
    ...
  }
}
```

- `id`: The id of the user as provided by the Identity Provider. (SAML SLO request requires you to pass `id` as `nameId`. Save
  `id` if you have a plan to implement SLO in the future.)
- `email`: The email address of the user as provided by the Identity Provider
- `firstName`: The first name of the user as provided by the Identity Provider
- `lastName`: The last name of the user as provided by the Identity Provider
- `raw`: This contains all claims attributes returned by the SAML provider
- `requested`: This contains the `tenant`, `product`, `client_id` and `state` from the authorize request. It can be used to
  reconcile context on the client side if needed

## SAML SLO

SLO is a SAML flow that allows an end-user to logout of a single session and be automatically logged out of all linked sessions
created during the SSO process.

The SLO flow begins with redirecting your user to the `/api/logout` endpoint.

```bash
https://localhost:5225/api/logout
  ?nameId=google-auth0-f92cc1834efc0f73e9c09
  &tenant=ory.sh
  &product=demo
  &redirectUrl=http://www.example.com/logout
```

- `nameId`: Identifies the subject of a SAML assertion (Typically the user who is authenticated)
- `tenant`: The tentant
- `product`: The product
- `redirectUrl`: Post logout redirect URL

IdP will send a response (as a POST operation) to a specific URL (Single Logout URL) for the logout request. You need to register
this URL on the IdP `/api/logout/callback` to handle the response.

Ory Polis will redirect users to `redirectUrl` after the successful logout.

You should save the `id` returned by the `userinfo` for an user so that you can use the `id` as `nameId` with SLO request.
