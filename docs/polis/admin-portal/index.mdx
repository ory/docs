Ory Polis comes with an Admin Portal that allows you to manage **Enterprise SSO**, **Directory Sync** and **Setup Links** products
via an easy to use web interface.

To enable the Admin Portal, make sure you deploy [Ory Polis as a service](../quickstart.mdx).

## Authentication methods

Ory Polis supports multiple authentication methods. You can choose to use any of the following methods to authenticate users to
the Admin Portal.

We use [NextAuth](https://next-auth.js.org) to handle authentication. Set the following environment variables to configure the
authentication.

- `NEXTAUTH_URL`: The URL of your app.
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`: A secret used to encrypt the session cookie. You can generate one using `openssl rand -base64 32`

### Magic links

With Magic Links, you can sign in to the Admin Portal without having to enter a password. The app will send you an email with a
link to sign in. You'll need SMTP server credentials to send emails.

Configure the following environment variables to enable Magic Links.

- `SMTP_HOST`: SMTP server host
- `SMTP_PORT`: SMTP server port
- `SMTP_USER`: SMTP server username
- `SMTP_PASSWORD`: SMTP server password
- `SMTP_FROM`: From email address to use when sending Magic Link emails
- `NEXTAUTH_ACL`: An array of emails or glob patterns. Only these users will be allowed access to the Admin Portal. For example:
  `NEXTAUTH_ACL=tonystark@gmail.com,*@marvel.com`

Follow the below steps to login into the Admin Portal.

- Visit the path `/api/auth/signin` on your app.
- Enter the email address that matches the `NEXTAUTH_ACL` and click the button **Send Magic Link**.
- Open the inbox and you'll see an email from Ory Polis.
- Open that email and click the button **Sign in**.

### Email and password

With Email and üassword, you can sign in to the Admin Portal using an email address and password. You can use it as an alternative
to Magic Links or SAML Single Sign-On. This is the easiest way to get started with the Admin Portal.

Configure the environment variable to enable Email and üassword authentication.

- `NEXTAUTH_ADMIN_CREDENTIALS`: A comma separated list of email and password pairs. For example:
  `david@acme.com:secretpassword,john@acme.com:anotherpassword`

At the moment, set the password as plain text. We'll add support for encrypted passwords soon.

Follow the below steps to login into the Admin Portal.

- Visit the path `/api/auth/signin` on your app.
- Enter the email address and password that matches the `NEXTAUTH_ADMIN_CREDENTIALS` and click the button **Sign In**.

### SAML or OIDC Single Sign-On

With SAML or OIDC Single Sign-On, you can sign in to the Admin Portal using your Identity Provider. The app will redirect you to
your Identity Provider to sign in. Once you've signed in, you'll be redirected back to the Admin Portal.

Configure the following environment variables to enable SAML or OIDC Single Sign-On.

- `ADMIN_PORTAL_SSO_TENANT`: This will be used as the tenant for the SSO connections. Set this to a value that is less likely to
  conflict with the main Enterprise SSO connections.
- `ADMIN_PORTAL_SSO_PRODUCT`: This will be used as the product for the SSO connections. Set this to a value that is less likely to
  conflict with the main Enterprise SSO connections.

If not set, the default values will be used which are `_polis_boxyhq` and `_polis_admin_portal`.

To enable SAML/OIDC Single Sign-On, you'll need to access the Admin Portal using either magic links or email and password. Once
you've logged in, you can configure SAML/OIDC Single Sign-On from the Admin Portal.

Go to **Settings** > **SSO for Admin Portal** and add a new SSO connection. Ory Polis supports both SAML and OIDC protocols.

Follow the below steps to login into the Admin Portal.

- Visit the path `/api/auth/signin` on your app.
- Click the button **Login with SSO**.
- You'll be redirected to your SAML Identity Provider to sign in for the authentication and then redirected back to the Admin
  Portal.
