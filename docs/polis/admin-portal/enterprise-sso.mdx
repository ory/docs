# Manage SSO connections

On the Admin Portal **Enterprise SSO** menu, you can see the SSO Connections details.

## Add SAML connections

Once you've set up the SAML app on your Identity Provider, the Identity Provider will generate a SAML Metadata file.

The SAML metadata file contains information about the various SAML Authorities that can be used in SAML 2.0 protocol message
exchanges.

Download the SAML Metadata file from your IdP and follow the below steps for adding the SAML connection.

- Click the button **New Connection**.
- Choose **SAML** as the type.
- Give your new connection a **name**.
- Add your **Tenant** (Eg: ory.com) and **Product** (Eg: flex).
- Add **Allowed redirect URLs**.
- Add **Default redirect URL**.
- Paste the **Raw IdP XML**.
- If **ForceAuthn** is checked, it means that the user will be forced to re-authenticate at SAML IdP, even if they have an active
  session.
- Click the button **Save Changes**.

Now you've successfully added your first SAML connection.

## Add OIDC connections

Once you've registered the OIDC app on your Identity Provider, the Identity Provider will generate a clientId and clientSecret.

The `clientSecret` will be used to authenticate the OIDC client (in this case Ory Polis) and obtain the `access_token`.

Also get the OpenID provider [discovery](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html#ProviderConfig) endpoint
(usually ending in `/.well-known/openid-configuration`) and follow the below steps for adding the OIDC connection.

- Click the button **New Connection**.
- Choose **OIDC** as the type.
- Give your new connection a **name**.
- Add your **Tenant** (Eg: ory.com) and **Product** (Eg: flex).
- Add **Allowed redirect URLs**.
- Add **Default redirect URL**.
- Enter the URL for OpenID Provider discovery which exposes the Provider Metadata.
- Paste the **clientId** and **clientSecret** values into Client ID [OIDC Provider]/Client Secret [OIDC Provider] fields in the
  UI.
- Click the button **Save Changes**.

Now you've successfully added your first OIDC connection.

## SAML federation

SAML Federation is an enterprise feature and you need to have an enterprise license to use this feature.

From the **Admin Portal** go to **Enterprise SSO** > **SAML Federation**.

  - **Name**

  - **Product**
  - **ACS URL** (ACS URL of the SP)

### Update SAML federation app

- From the list of SAML Federation Apps, click on the **Edit** icon of the app you want to update.
- You can update the following information:
  - **Name**
  - **ACS URL** (ACS URL of the SP)
  - **Entity ID** (Entity ID of the SP)

### View IdP configuration

Click **View IdP Configuration** button to view the IdP configuration for the SAML Federation App. You need to provide the SP with
the following information:

- **SSO URL**
- **Entity ID / Audience URI / Audience Restriction**
