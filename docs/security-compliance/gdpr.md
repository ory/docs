## How Ory Network helps you to be GDPR compliant

Adopting Ory Network as your identity management solution represents a big step towards becoming GDPR compliant. Ory is dedicated
to upholding the highest standards in data protection and also provides you with the option of hosting personal data on EU based
servers.

The following GDPR checklist provides an overview of how Ory Network can bring you closer to overall GDPR compliance.

### GDPR checklist

According to the EU Commission's guidelines on
[Rules for business and organisations](https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/reform/rules-business-and-organisations_en),
there is an extensive set of GDPR rules that affect the processing of EU citizens' personal data. The following table summarizes
this aspect of the GDPR regulations and indicates the level at which Ory Network supports compliance.

Where the support levels in this table are, as follows:

- ![Single check mark](./_common/check-mark-single.svg) - Compliance with this GDPR regulation is mainly the responsibility of the
  customer.
- ![Single check mark green](./_common/check-mark-single-green.svg) - Ory Network is compliant and/or facilitates compliance with
  this GDPR regulation.
- ![Double check mark green](./_common/check-mark-double-green.svg) - Ory Network has special features that strongly support
  compliance with this aspect of GDPR.

:::caution

The purpose of the preceding checklist is to help you understand how Ory Network can assist you with making your applications and
systems GDPR compliant. This checklist does not list the complete provisions of the GDPR and is **not** a substitutes for due
diligence and conducting your own research. Only the text of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has legal force.

:::

### EU based servers

In the context of the GDPR, cross-border transfers of personal data are problematic. The GDPR rules for international data
transfer are derived from the principle that _"protection offered by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) travels with
the data"_. Transferring data to a third country outside the EU is therefore not generally permitted, unless the the EU accepts
that the destination country upholds data protection standards equivalent to GDPR. The only exceptions are for those countries the
EU has certified as a _safe destination_ for data, through a so-called "Adequacy Decision". Unfortunately, until now very few
countries have been certified, and the list of certified countries does **not** include the US.

Hence, in most cases, in order to be GDPR compliant, your company needs to store personal data for European customers on EU based
servers. With Ory Network, you can choose to store all of your identity data on EU based servers, which ensures compliance with
this aspect of GDPR.

### Integrity and confidentiality

The GDPR requires companies to take technical measures to ensure data integrity and confidentiality. At Ory, data integrity and
confidentiality are central to our mission and we adhere to recommended industry standards and security practices to ensure your
data remains safe. In particular, these measures include:

- Ory Network forces HTTPS for all services using TLS 1.2 or higher, including our public website, the Ory Console, and the Ory
  Network APIs to ensure data is encrypted in transit.
- Any data stored by the Ory Network is encrypted at rest using industry best practice standard AES-256 Password Encryption Ory
  uses salted bcrypt to ensure passwords are stored securely.
- The Ory Network implements a backup strategy to ensure regular backups are created and stored in an encrypted fashion.

### Protection against data breaches

The GDPR also requires companies to protect personal data and prevent data breaches. Ory has multiple policies and technical
measures in place to keep your data safe:

- **Vulnerability management** &mdash; Ory embeds vulnerability scans into the CI/CD pipelines and scans all containers built for
  deployment. In addition, at runtime all containers running in our clusters are scanned continuously to report findings.

- **Third party penetration testing** &mdash; Third party pen tests are conducted on a quarterly basis to ensure regular
  verification of our systems and procedures.

- **Bug bounty program** &mdash; Ory's disclosure and reward program supports anyone who wants to increase the security of the Ory
  Network by conducting external pen testing.

- **Secure cloud deployment** &mdash; Google Cloud Platform provides secure and scalable infrastructure that meets Ory's strict
  requirements and compliance needs.

- **Logging and audit trail** &mdash; Ory uses logging in its cloud network. enabling forensic analysis of potential incidents.
