## ISO 27001

verify the ISO 27001:2013 certification directly with [our auditor](https://barrcertifications.com/certificate-directory/). The
ISO 27001 certification verifies that Ory has an information security management system (ISMS) in place to assure the
confidentiality and integrity of your data. Our internal security team is dedicated to ensuring that Ory maintains the highest
standards of data protection.

## SOC 2 Type 2

Ory is SOC 2 Type 2 certified. SOC 2 is a framework for assessing the security, availability, processing integrity,
confidentiality, and privacy of data in service organizations. It is not a standard but a certification that demonstrates that an
organization's internal controls and processes meet specific criteria. The Type 2 designation indicates that an independent
auditor has evaluated and tested these controls over a period of time (typically three months to a year) to ensure they are
effectively implemented. Current and prospective customers interested in obtaining a copy of Ory’s latest SOC 2 report may request
access at the [Ory Trust Center](https://trust.ory.com/).

## GDPR
