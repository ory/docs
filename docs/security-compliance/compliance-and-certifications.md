programs and adopted the best industry practices and technologies to keep our customers' data safe.

## ISO 27001

Ory holds a certificate for [ISO 27001:2013](https://www.iso.org/standard/27001), which you can can
[download for inspection](https://www.ory.sh/resources/iso27001/OryCorp-ISO27001-Certificate-of-Registration.pdf). You can also
verify the ISO 27001:2013 certification directly with [our auditor](https://barrcertifications.com/certificate-directory/). The
ISO 27001 certification verifies that Ory has an information security management system (ISMS) in place to assure the
confidentiality and integrity of your data. Our internal security team is dedicated to ensuring that Ory maintains the highest
standards of data protection.

## SOC 2

SOC 2 Type 1 and Type 2 attestation is underway. Ory is committed to protecting customer data and conducting a rigorous audit
process to verify that all security controls are in place.

:::note

SOC 2 certification demands a comparable level of data protection and security processes as the ISO 27001 standard, but the SOC 2
certification is more widely recognized in North America.
