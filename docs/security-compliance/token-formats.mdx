Ory is an open-source service that allows developers to secure their applications using different protocols such as OAuth 2.0,
OpenID Connect, and Ory Sessions. In this article, we will discuss Ory's credential formats, including access tokens, refresh
tokens, and authorization codes, and their prefixes, which make them easily identifiable for auditing and security purposes.

## Ory OAuth2 token prefixes

Ory prefixes its access tokens, refresh tokens, and authorization codes with identifiable strings, making it easy for security
scanners to identify leaked tokens. These prefixes are:

- `ory_at`: OAuth 2.0 Access Token
- `ory_rt`: OAuth 2.0 Refresh Token
- `ory_ac`: OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code

It is important to note that when using JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), the prefix is not applied.

Using these prefixes is a best practice for identifying OAuth2 credentials in code scanning tools, which can help to prevent
security breaches and unauthorized access.

## Ory session cookies

Ory also issues session cookies to maintain user sessions across requests. Session cookies are usually used to store user
authentication information, such as the user ID, and can be used to provide a seamless user experience. Ory session cookies are
prefixed with the ory*session* prefix, making them easily identifiable in logs and tracking tools.

Session cookies are essential for maintaining user sessions, and Ory ensures that session cookies are secure and tamper-proof.
Developers can configure the expiration time and cookie options for Ory session cookies to fit their application's specific needs.

In summary, Ory session cookies are prefixed with ory*session* and are essential for maintaining user sessions. They can be
customized to fit specific application needs and are secure and tamper-proof.

## Ory session tokens

Ory session tokens are used to maintain user sessions and can be used in place of session cookies for applications that do not
support cookies. Session tokens contain authentication information that is used to validate the user's identity and provide access
to protected resources. Ory session tokens are prefixed with the `ory_st_` prefix, which makes them easily identifiable and
distinguishes them from other types of tokens.

## Ory Identities logout tokens

Ory logout tokens are used to log out users from their sessions. When a user logs out, their session is terminated, and they are
no longer able to access protected resources. Ory issues logout tokens with the `ory_lo_` prefix, which makes them easily
identifiable and distinguishes them from other types of tokens.
