Ory is a software infrastructure provider building a global zero-trust network for humans, robots, devices, and software services.
Ory develops open-source software on [GitHub](https://github.com/ory) and publishes open standards such as the
[Ory Permission Language](https://github.com/ory/keto/blob/master/docs/ory_permission_language_spec.md).
[The Ory Network](https://console.ory.com/) uses cloud-native open-source technologies (Kubernetes, Crossplane, Cockroach, Linux,
Ory) and standards (OAuth 2.0/2.1, OpenID Connect, MITREid, WebAuthn, TOTP, FIDO3) to deliver a low-latency, planet-scale
zero-trust infrastructure. Ory combines centuries of open source, security, operational, and industry expertise with a
user-centric and security-first mindset.

Core infrastructure components of [Ory Network](https://console.ory.com) are open source to foster collaboration, reduce supply
chain risk, broaden access to secure services, and introduce the open standard for internet security. Being open source Ory
improves the safety of everyone:

- Ory Identities offers a secure and modern central identity management solution with MFA, passwordless, WebAuthn, and more. It's
  based on the open-source [Ory Kratos Identity Server](https://github.com/ory/kratos).
- Ory OAuth2 & OpenID Connect implements 15+ IETF and OpenID standards to facilitate single sign-on (SSO), delegation, and API
  access authorization. It's based on the open-source [Ory Hydra Federation Server](https://github.com/ory/hydra).
- Ory Permissions is a low-latency, high-performance, relationship-based authorization system that enables fine-grained access
  control (incl. RBAC and ABAC models) in any application. It's based on the open-source
  [Ory Keto Permission Server](https://github.com/ory/keto), which implements
  [Zanzibar: Google’s Consistent, Global Authorization System](https://research.google/pubs/pub48190/).

Ory develops and maintains many additional open-source projects. From an Ory Zero Trust Identity & Access Proxy
[Ory Oathkeeper](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper) to developer tooling [Ory Dockertest](https://github.com/ory/dockertest) to
language-specific libraries [Ory Ladon](https://github.com/ory/ladon). Ory has
[170+ open source repositories](https://github.com/orgs/ory/repositories) and over 35.000 GitHub stars.

Ory secures billions of requests each month, runs in over 50,000 live deployments, and improves hourly.

## Why Ory is different

Ory differentiates from other vendors in the following key areas:

- Ory core services and APIs are developed and licensed under Apache 2.0, allowing you to participate, collaborate, and understand
  the inner workings of Ory.
- You can bring your UI, in the programming language of your choosing, with the user experience that you like.
- From designing Identity Schemas using JSON Schema, to webhooks, to advanced configuration options - Ory is the most customizable
  platform out there.
- Ory spans the whole authentication and authorization universe with well-designed products and APIs:
  - Identity Management with session management & flows for login, registration, recovery, verification, MFA, and more.
  - Permission and Role Management.
  - Delegation via OAuth2 and OpenID Connect.
  - Zero Trust Networking.
  - Modern API design with partial support for gRPC.

## Ory Network

The Ory Network is the commercial offering of Ory and is built on top of Ory Open Source software. The goal with Ory Network is to
offer a planet-scale, low-latency, resilient, and secure service that's easy to use and set up.

In short: Ory Network is the most convenient way to run Ory. [Sign up](https://console.ory.com/registration) and create a free

## Components

Each project in Ory Network is an isolated tenant and uses many components providing functionality, user interfaces, and APIs
around identities, sessions, login, OAuth2, permissions, and more. The core components of projects in Ory Network are
[Ory Open Source servers](https://github.com/ory/).

### Identities and sessions

Ory Network incorporates the open-source [Ory Kratos Identity Server](https://www.ory.com/kratos) and offers:

- Self-service flows are everything users do on their own / without the help of others:
- Registration with passwords, social sign-in, OpenID Connect, passkeys, and more.
- Login with passwords, social sign-in, OpenID Connect, passkeys, and more.
- Updating the profile, email, changing the password, un/linking with social sign-in providers, and more.
- Recovering the account by resetting the password.
- Verifying email addresses, phone numbers, and more.
- Multi-factor authentication flows and recovery processes.
- Administrative identity management to get, create, update, and delete identities and their data.
- Headless APIs and data models allow you to fully customize Identity Schemas - for example adding fields like name, accept ToS,
  phone number - and create your login, registration, profile settings, recovery, and verification screen using SDKs and REST
  APIs.
- SCIM support for automated user provisioning and deprovisioning with supported identity providers.

### Permissions and relationships

Ory Network incorporates the open-source [Ory Keto Permission Server](https://www.ory.com/keto) and offers:

- Permission management to get, create, update, and delete permissions.
- Permission checking to check if a user has a permission.

### OAuth2 and OIDC

Ory Network incorporates the open-source [Ory Hydra OAuth2 & OpenID Server](https://www.ory.com/hydra) and offers:

- Fully featured OAuth2 & [OpenID Certified](https://openid.net/developers/certified/)® OIDC Provider

### SAML

Ory Network incorporates the open-source [Ory Polis](https://www.ory.com/polis) and offers:

- Enterprise SSO integration with SAML identity providers such as Okta, Azure AD, and Google Workspace.
- Simplified SSO flow by implementing SSO as a standard OAuth 2.0 flow, abstracting away the complexities of SAML.
- Act as a SAML Identity Provider (IdP).

### Ory Console

Ory Console is the management UI of Ory Network.

### Ory Account Experience

Ory Account Experience implements screens such as login, registration, account recovery, account setting, and account verification
for fast adoption of Ory.

Contrary to other vendors, Ory allows you to implement your own (login, registration, ...) UI by offering simple, headless APIs.
Use the open-source [Ory Elements](https://github.com/ory/elements) components library for fast integration with frameworks like
ExpressJS, React, or Preact.

### Ory Actions

[Ory Actions](./kratos/hooks/configure-hooks) provide a flexible way to extend the capabilities of the Ory Network by defining
custom business logic, automating system behavior in response to events, and integrating with third-party services such as CRM
platforms, payment gateways, business analytics tools, and integration platforms.

## Ory Open Source

Ory is the largest open-source ecosystem in the area of authentication, authorization, access control, and zero-trust networking
in the world. Ory is not another company "greenwashing" with open source by publishing SDKs under open-source licenses. Instead,
all Ory core systems are available as Apache 2.0 licensed software without enterprise or open-core models.
