## Postman collections

> Note that while we try to keep the collections up to date, they might be outdated. Please open an
> [issue](https://github.com/ory/docs/) if that's the case.

First, you have to install the Postman App for Windows, Mac, or Chrome. You can find it on the
[Postman Apps](https://www.getpostman.com/apps) page.

Visit the [Ory Postman Public Workspace](https://www.postman.com/ory-docs) and select the Collection you want to use and import it
or select the Ory project you want to run below:

[![Run Ory Hydra in Postman](./_static/community/postmanHydra.svg)](https://god.gw.postman.com/run-collection/12423954-77f31af1-20a1-4e98-a678-dcb18c64bbe1?action=collection%2Ffork&collection-url=entityId%3D12423954-77f31af1-20a1-4e98-a678-dcb18c64bbe1%26entityType%3Dcollection%26workspaceId%3Dba1e6798-1497-4918-a896-cac2f90d481b)

[![Run Ory Kratos in Postman](./_static/community/postmanKratos.svg)](https://www.postman.com/ory-docs/workspace/ory/api/bfd3b52e-8125-447c-b0ea-75d34f653377)

[![Run Ory Keto in Postman](./_static/community/postmanKeto.svg)](https://god.gw.postman.com/run-collection/12423954-50913dea-51f8-43f3-919f-9dc16ae1353b?action=collection%2Ffork&collection-url=entityId%3D12423954-50913dea-51f8-43f3-919f-9dc16ae1353b%26entityType%3Dcollection%26workspaceId%3Dba1e6798-1497-4918-a896-cac2f90d481b)

[![Run Ory Oathkeeper in Postman](./_static/community/postmanOathkeeper.svg)](https://god.gw.postman.com/run-collection/12423954-79a6cee9-0d7c-4c4a-97b3-8b86074136db?action=collection%2Ffork&collection-url=entityId%3D12423954-79a6cee9-0d7c-4c4a-97b3-8b86074136db%26entityType%3Dcollection%26workspaceId%3Dba1e6798-1497-4918-a896-cac2f90d481b)

Our API Collections are built directly from the swagger specification (you can find it at the path `/spec/api.json`) and are
organized into folders that categorize the various API calls.

For example, in the Ory Kratos collection, you will find all calls related to `identity` in the folder with the same name.

To be able to work with the collection you need to set the `baseURl` variable. For example, when running Ory Kratos as configured,
the `baseURl` needs to be set to the public endpoint(in the [Quickstart](https://www.ory.sh/kratos/docs/quickstart) it
is`http://127.0.0.1:4433/`).

You may also have to configure query parameters or the JSON method body, depending on the API call.

:::info

Don't store tokens in Postman as environment variables! If you are signed in to the Postman application, it will automatically try
to synchronize Collections and Environments with the Postman servers. This means that a token, which could allow someone else
access to your APIs, is being uploaded to Postman's servers. Postman has taken measures to ensure that tokens are encrypted and
encourages users to store them in Environment Variables. Read more [here](https://www.postman.com/security).
