## Postman collections

> Note that while the collections should be up to date, they might be outdated. Please open an
> [issue](https://github.com/ory/docs/) if that's the case.

- First, you have to install the Postman App for Windows, Mac, or Chrome. You can find it on the
  [Postman Apps](https://www.getpostman.com/apps) page.

- Visit the [Ory Postman Public Workspace](https://www.postman.com/ory-docs) and select the API for the Ory service you want to
  use.

The API Collections are built directly from the swagger specification (you can find it at the path `/spec/api.json` in GitHub) and
are organized into folders that categorize the various API calls. To be able to work with the collection you need to set the
`baseURl` variable. For example, when running Ory Kratos the `baseURl` needs to be set to the public endpoint. You may also have
to configure query parameters or the JSON method body, depending on the API call.

:::info

Don't store tokens in Postman as environment variables! If you are signed in to the Postman application, it will automatically try
to synchronize Collections and Environments with the Postman servers. This means that a token, which could allow someone else
access to your APIs, is being uploaded to Postman's servers. Postman has taken measures to ensure that tokens are encrypted and
encourages users to store them in Environment Variables. Read more [here](https://www.postman.com/security).
