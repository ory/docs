## Roadmap

Ory is actively being developed. If you are interested in a particular project, it's best to check out the
[open issues & pull requests ](#milestones-issues-pull-requests) for that project.

Please note that our roadmap is **subject to change**. This means that development is considering feedback both from the Open
Source community as well as Ory Network users.

Issues on GitHub aren't hard and fixed commitments. GitHub Issues, Pull Requests, and Discussions are general guidelines and
efforts to make development at Ory as transparent as possible to facilitate collaboration, trust, and visibility.

### Feedback

If you are a user of our Open Source offering and you have feedback, please do so in [GitHub Discussions](#discussions) or on the
[Ory Community Slack](https://slack.ory.sh/).

Please also vote on issues and discussions with a thumbs up. We will ask for community feedback on important changes and consider
the popularity of features in the community when planning development.

### Bugs

Every release from Ory includes new features as well as bug fixes. You can find a changelog in the main directory of every
project. If you happen to find a bug, please open an isse in the relevant repository. We appreciate it when you include steps for
replication, version information, logs, and as much information as you think is helpful. This makes squashing that pesky bug much
easier for us.

We prioritize bug fixes based on the impact of the issue, how many users are affected, estimated effort, and other factors.
