title: Roadmap
---

Ory is actively being developed. The [maturity of our software](versioning.md) varies from product to product.

Users are often asking when a particular feature will be implemented or when it can be expected to be available.

This document strives to give an answer to those questions and give you an outlook of what's happening in the Ory ecosystem.
Please note that this roadmap is mainly focused on the Ory Open Source libraries - but this also influences the development of Ory
Cloud.

## Ory Roadmap

If you are interested in a particular project, it's best to check out the
[milestones and open issues & pull requests ](#milestones-issues-pull-requests) for that project.

Please note that **our roadmap is subject to changes**. This means that development is considering feedback both from the Open
Source community as well as Ory Cloud users.

Issues on GitHub aren't hard and fixed commitments. GitHub Issues, Milestones, and Discussions are general guidelines and efforts
to make development at Ory as transparent as possible to facilitate collaboration, trust, and visibility.

Visit [this page](./changelog.md) to see the changelogs for all Ory projects.

## Feedback

If you are a user of our Open Source offering and you have feedback, please do so in [GitHub Discussions](#discussions) or
directly on the [Community Slack](https://slack.ory.sh/).

Please also vote on issues and discussions with a thumbs up. We will ask for community feedback on important changes and consider
the popularity of features in the community when planning development.

## Bugs

Every release from Ory includes new features as well as bug fixes. You can find a full changelog in the main directory of every
project ( [ for Ory Kratos](https://github.com/ory/kratos/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md))

If you happen to find a bug, please open an [issue](#milestones-issues-pull-requests) in the relevant repository. We appreciate it
when you include steps for replication, version information, logs, and as much information as you think is helpful. This makes
squashing that pesky bug much easier for us.

We prioritize bug fixes based on the impact of the issue, how many users are affected, estimated effort, and other factors.

## I want that feature now, how can I make it happen?

First, you should check if an [issue](#milestones-issues-pull-requests) or a [discussion](#discussions) for that feature already
exists.

If it doesn't exist, please open a [discussion](#discussions) in the "Ideas" section and try to formulate as accurately as
possible what you are trying to do, what you are expecting how it should work, as well as any technical details that are relevant.
This helps others to understand your idea and maintainers will discuss the next steps with you.

If it does exist, feel free to voice your support for that feature or open a road to implementation. Generally, there are several
things you can do to getting a feature implemented faster:

- Contribute

If you think that you can contribute to that particular feature, maintainers will do their best to give you the right pointers and
review PRs. We also really appreciate non-code contributions, i.e. documentation, feedback, ideas, ...

For more information please refer to the projects CONTRIBUTING.md ( for
[Ory Kratos](https://github.com/ory/kratos/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)).

- Support Ory

If writing code yourself isn't an option, you can consider becoming an Ory Sponsor on
[Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/ory) or [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/_ory). This helps us to employ more
maintainers and technical staff - increasing velocity in development, community, interaction, and other areas!

All collected money goes directly into open source development.
