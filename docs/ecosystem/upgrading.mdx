Good software improves over time. If it wouldn't, you shouldn't use it. Unfortunately, some of these improvements have breaking
changes. We know that breaking changes are annoying so we want to make upgrading as painless as possible.

We document changelogs and upgrade guides for Ory services:

- Ory Kratos: [upgrade guide](../kratos/guides/upgrade), [changelog](https://github.com/ory/kratos/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)
- Ory Hydra: [upgrade guide](https://github.com/ory/hydra/blob/master/UPGRADE.md),
  [changelog](https://github.com/ory/hydra/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)
- Ory Oathkeeper: [upgrade guide](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/blob/master/UPGRADE.md),
  [changelog](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)
- Ory Keto: [upgrade guide](https://github.com/ory/keto/blob/master/UPGRADE.md),
  [changelog](https://github.com/ory/keto/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

Before upgrading to a newer version, please make sure to check with these documents first.

## Versioning

Ory uses a calendar-based versioning system, where the version format is `YY.Q.N`, representing the year, quarter, and release
number within that quarter. For example, version `25.2.0` indicates a release in the second quarter of 2025, with `0` being the
first release in that quarter. The release number increases with each subsequent release during the quarter. This system helps
users understand when a version was released and how recent it is. Starting from October 2025, all Ory components use a common
version number, meaning releases are synchronized across all components such as Kratos, Hydra, Oathkeeper, and Keto. This unified
versioning simplifies upgrades and ensures compatibility across the entire Ory ecosystem.
