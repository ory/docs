title: Software Versions
---

The Ory ecosystem consists of multiple services versioned using
[semantic versioning](https://semver.org). This section explains how we define
service versions and what they mean.

## Development Stages

There are three main stages of development for services:

- **Graduated:** Mature implementations of proven concepts. They rarely change
  in backwards incompatible ways. A software is considered graduated if the
  major version is >= 1, e.g. `v1.0.1`, `v2.2.2`. Backwards incompatible changes
  are indicated by a bump of the major version number. Most, if not all, REST
  APIs will provide backwards compatible transformations that make it possible
  to interact with the server using older API versions.
- **Incubating:** Implements well defined but not fully matured concepts.
  Incubating software has a major version number of `0`, e.g. `v0.10.0`. You may
  see a pre-release version such as `v0.10.0-beta.1`. Incubating software has a
  higher (but overall moderate) probability for larger changes that can break
  backwards compatibility, for which there are upgrade guides.
- **Sandbox:** Implements concepts, APIs and CLIs at the experimental stage and
  may change in unpredictable ways. Sandbox software has a major version number
  of `0` with a `alpha` or `beta` pre-release indicator, e.g. `v0.10.0-alpha.1`.
  It is more likely that you'll encounter a version tag with a `alpha`
  pre-release version. We will provide upgrade guides wherever possible,
  especially when they are used in production already.

The following is a list of maturity level per project:

- [Ory Hydra](https://github.com/ory/hydra) is a **graduated** project.
- [Ory Oathkeeper](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper) is a **incubating**
  project.
- [Ory Kratos](https://github.com/ory/kratos) is a **sandbox** project.
- [Ory Keto](https://github.com/ory/keto) is a **sandbox** project.

:::info

Ory only releases software that is stable and ready for production!  
The sandbox/incubating stage does _not_ mean the product is not ready to be
used.  
It is an indicator of _how much_ the project will change in the future,
including backwards incompatible changes.

## Changelog

### March 2020 Change

As of March 2020, the `oryOS` semantics have been deprecated and will no longer
be used.

The `oryOS` versioning was introduced as a way to declare compatibility between
the different projects. This was necessary as parts of Ory Hydra were split into
new projects called Ory Keto and Ory Oathkeeper.

As of today however, these projects are largely independent. Future versions of
these projects will also include versioned APIs which renders the `oryOS`
semantics unnecessary.

If compatibility is an issue, it will be highlighted in the project's
documentation.

The next sections document the previous behavior and are kept for historical
reasons.

Old documentation links with `oryOS.<x>` in the URL are going to keep working in
the foreseeable future.

#### oryOS Semantics

To make deployment easier but stay compatible with semantic versioning, each
service is equipped with a `oryOS` version number denoted by `+oryOS.X` where
`X` represents the "ecosystem" version. This is especially useful if you use
more than one service from the Ory ecosystem. Let's look at some examples:

- Ory Hydra `v1.0.1+oryOS.6` is best compatible with Ory Oathkeeper
  `v0.13.1+oryOS.6` and Ory Keto `v0.5.1+oryOS.6`.
- Ory Hydra `v1.0.2+oryOS.7` is best compatible with Ory Oathkeeper
  `v0.13.2+oryOS.7` and Ory Keto `v0.6.0+oryOS.7`.
- Ory Hydra `v1.0.3+oryOS.8` is probably not fully compatible with Ory
  Oathkeeper `v0.13.1+oryOS.6` nor with Ory Keto `v0.5.1+oryOS.6`.
- Ory Hydra `v1.1.0+oryOS.9` is best compatible with Ory Oathkeeper
  `v1.1.0+oryOS.9` and Ory Keto `v1.1.0+oryOS.9`.

It is possible that a number of releases are versioned with the same `oryOS.x`
version metadata:

- Ory Hydra `v1.0.1+oryOS.10`, `v1.0.2+oryOS.10` is guaranteed compatible with
  Ory Oathkeeper `v0.15.5+oryOS.10`, `v1.16.0+oryOS.10` and Ory Keto
  `v0.1.1+oryOS.10`, `v0.1.2+oryOS.10`.

We always provide ways to migrate breaking changes, and all breaking changes are
meticulously described in each project's `UPGRADE.md` as well as `HISTORY.md`.

### Package repository limitations

Several package repositories such as
[Docker Hub](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/16304), NPM, and others do not
allow build metadata in the version tag.

Therefore, we generally strip the `oryOS` metadata from the versions published
on package repositories (e.g. NPM, Ruby Gems, Packagist, Maven Central, Go ...).

### January 2020 Change

As of January 2020 (oryOS.15) we will no longer use `-sandbox` to indicate the
sandbox stage. Instead, please check the [maturity](#maturity) section. We made
this change because some package manager (e.g. Ruby Gems) do not allow the
`-sandbox` suffix in the version.

### November 2018 Change

If you are an adopter of the Ory Keto or Ory Oathkeeper prior to November 2018,
this section is for you.

#### Why

Before November 2018, Ory Keto and Ory Oathkeeper were available as versions
`v1.0.0-beta.1` through `v1.0.0-beta.9`. We wanted to make versioning as easy as
possible across all services. For example, if you ran Ory Hydra `v1.2.3` and Ory
Oathkeeper `v1.2.3` both versions would be guaranteed compatible.

This turned out to be a bad decision because of multiple factors:

1. As Ory Hydra was moving towards `v1.0.0`, Ory Oathkeeper and Ory Keto were
   still rather new projects and some of them required breaking changes to
   improve the value of the technology. But semantic versioning, which is a
   de-facto standard, has strong implications on breaking changes in software
   labeled as `v1.x.y`. While we had plans to add tags like `-sandbox` to
   software, labeled as `v1` but not fully matured, we quickly realized that
   this would only add to confusion.
2. While certain services matured rather quickly and the community was eagerly
   awaiting the next release, we had to hold back because of unfinished changes
   to other projects. Ory Hydra `v1.0.0-rc.2` was put on delay because we wanted
   other systems to feel `v1`-ish, which required a lot of work, stress and
   caused delays. This lead to a misalignment between what the community wants
   (Ory Hydra rc1) and what had to be added to the roadmap in order to comply
   with the versioning concept.
3. We are working towards an open source identity management system (Ory Hive)
   which will stay in sandbox and incubation for a while due to its complexity.
   We definitely did not want to give the impression that early MVPs are `v1` or
   even `v2`.

Our plan to help developers understand which versions are compatible with one
another backfired and instead we delayed releases and developers were confused
as to the maturity of the individual services.

#### Upgrading

The new versioning framework was published in November 2018 at the top of this
page. This is an overview of the things that changed.

##### Ory Hydra

No changes to the versioning will be made. The next release will remain
`v1.0.0-rc.2+oryOS.9`.

Going forward, the npm package `ory-hydra-sdk` will no longer be continued.
Instead, new versions will be pushed to `@oryd/hydra`. Version `v1.0.0-beta.9`
will be the last available version at `ory-hydra-sdk`. Version
`v1.0.0-rc.2+oryOS.9` will be the first version available at `@oryd/hydra`.

###### Version Matrix

| Old version     | Re-released as                  | NPM                           | Docker Hub                       |
| --------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `v1.0.0-beta.9` | -                               | `ory-hydra-sdk:v1.0.0-beta.9` | `oryd/hydra:v1.0.0-beta.9`       |
| -               | `v1.0.0-rc.2+oryOS.9` (example) | `@oryd/hydra:v1.0.0-rc.2`     | `oryd/hydra:v1.0.0-rc.2_oryOS.9` |

##### Ory Oathkeeper

Ory Oathkeeper is a service in incubation phase. To comply with the new
versioning framework, the following changes will be made:

- [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/releases) `v1.0.0-beta.1`
  to `v1.0.0-beta.9` have been removed as well as their binaries uploaded to
  GitHub Releases. Releases `v1.0.0-beta.1` to `v1.0.0-beta.9`, including
  binaries, have been re-released as `v0.13.1+oryOS.1` to `v0.13.9+oryOS.9`.
  Binaries, code, and functionality for versions `v1.0.0-beta.2+oryOS.2` and
  `v0.13.2+oryOS.2` are equal.
- [Git Tags](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/tags) will be removed on **Jan
  15th 2019**. Until then, you will be able to check out the specific commits
  using e.g. `git checkout v1.0.0-beta.2 -b my-branch`. Tags `v1.0.0-beta.1` to
  `v1.0.0-beta.9` will be re-released as `v0.13.1+oryOS.1` to `v0.13.9+oryOS.2`.
  After Jan 15th 2019 you will be able to get the same functionality as before,
  but you have to change the tag from `v1.0.0-beta.x` to `v0.13.x+oryOS.x`.
- Versions `v1.0.0-beta.1` to `v1.0.0-beta.9` will be removed from
  [Docker Hub `oryd/oathkeeper`](https://hub.docker.com/r/oryd/oathkeeper/) on
  **Jan 15th 2019**. These have been re-released according to the same rules
  that apply for Git Tags, but with `_oryOS.x` instead of `+oryOS.x`. Image
  `oryd/oathkeeper:v1.0.0-beta.2` will thus be available as
  `oryd/oathkeeper:v0.13.2_oryOS.2`.
- The npm package
  [`ory-oathkeeper-sdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ory-oathkeeper-sdk) will
  be deprecated. The new npm package will be available at `@oryd/oathkeeper`.
  The new npm package will only serve versions under the new format
  `v0.13.x+oryOS.x`.

##### Ory Keto

Ory Keto is a service in sandbox phase. To comply with the new versioning rules,
the following changes will be made:

- [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/ory/keto/releases) `v1.0.0-beta.1` to
  `v1.0.0-beta.9` have been removed as well as their binaries uploaded to GitHub
  Releases. Releases `v1.0.0-beta.1` to `v1.0.0-beta.9`, including binaries,
  have been re-released as `v0.1.1-sandbox+oryOS.1` to `v0.1.9-sandbox+oryOS.9`.
  Binaries, code, and functionality for versions `v1.0.0-beta.2` and
  `v0.1.2-sandbox+oryOS.2` are equal.
- [Git Tags](https://github.com/ory/keto/tags) will be removed on **Jan 15th
  2019**. Until then, you will be able to check out the specific commits using
  e.g. `git checkout v1.0.0-beta.2 -b my-branch`. Tags `v1.0.0-beta.1` to
  `v1.0.0-beta.9` will be re-released as `v0.1.1-sandbox+oryOS.1` to
  `v0.1.9-sandbox+oryOS.9`. After Jan 15th 2019 you will be able to get the same
  functionality as before, but you have to change the tag from `v1.0.0-beta.x`
  to `v0.1.x-sandbox+oryOS.x`.
- Versions `v1.0.0-beta.1` to `v1.0.0-beta.9` will be removed from
  [Docker Hub `oryd/keto`](https://hub.docker.com/r/oryd/keto/) on **Jan 15th
  2019**. These have been re-released according to the same rules that apply for
  Git Tags. Image `oryd/keto:v1.0.0-beta.2` will thus be available as
  `oryd/keto:v0.1.2-sandbox_oryOS.2`.
- The npm package [`ory-keto-sdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ory-keto-sdk)
  will be deprecated. The new npm package will be available at `@oryd/keto`. The
  new npm package will only serve versions under the new format
  `v0.1.x-sandbox+oryOS.x`.

The documentation got a major overhaul. We completely deprecated GitBook, which
is no longer being developed, and moved to [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).
Additionally, the API documentation is now integrated in Docusaurus using
[widdershins](https://github.com/Mermade/widdershins) with custom templates, and
no longer uses SwaggerUI. This is great, because everything is now in one
place - and we added code examples for consuming the REST API for all major
programming languages!

The new documentation will serve documentation the latest version (new version
semantics) only, this will be `oryOS.9`. This means that the following versions
will be documented in the new docs:

- Ory Hydra `v1.0.0-beta.9`
- Ory Oathkeeper `v0.13.9+oryOS.9`
- Ory Keto `v0.1.9-sandbox+oryOS.9`

If you need to look up documentation on older versions (in the old format), you
will be able to do so [here](https://www.ory.sh/docs/deprecated/latest/). This
documentation will be available for a reasonable amount of time and you will
receive a notice with ample time if we shut that down. You can view the legacy
REST API Documentation by browsing to the
[hosted swagger ui](https://petstore.swagger.io/) and entering, for example,
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ory/keto/v1.0.0-beta.8/docs/api.swagger.json`
in the top bar.

##### Ory Security Console

The Ory Security Console will be compatible with `oryOS.9`. While we work on
implementing the new changes there you might see error messages regarding
compatibility. You may ignore them for now.

##### Outlook

Versions `v1.0.0-beta.1` to `v1.0.0-beta.9` are blacklisted for Ory Oathkeeper
and Ory Keto. No future release will have those versions. This will prevent
potential future conflicts.
