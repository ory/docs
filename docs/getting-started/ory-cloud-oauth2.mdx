title: Perform OAuth2 Authorization Code Grant with Ory Cloud
sidebar_label: Federation with OAuth2
---

This guide shows you a sample implementation of the
[Authorization Code Grant](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749#section-1.3.1) OAuth2 flow using Ory OAuth2 Federation in Ory
Cloud. It takes you on a complete journey, from initial setup to running an OAuth2 flow.

:::tip

Ory OAuth2 Federation (based on [Ory Hydra](../hydra/index.md)) is available in Ory Cloud out of the box, which means you can use
OIDC, Authorization Code Grant, Client Credentials Grant, and more. Read [this document](../hydra/concepts/before-oauth2) to learn
more about OAuth2 and evaluate if it's the right fit for you.

:::

The implementation is based on a simple Node.js application with login and consent screens that allow you to simulate a common a
real-world scenario where an application (client) asks the user for consent to get access to certain data or operations (scopes).

For example, a service for selling goods allows users to add pictures from their Google Photos albums to their listings. To get
access to the user's photos, the OAuth2 client of the goods selling service asks the user for consent to access data on their
behalf. The request includes scopes - a list of operations the client wants to perform on behalf of the user. When the user
agrees, the OAuth2 client gets an authorization code which it exchanges for an `id_token` and `access_token` pair issued by Google
Photos. These tokens allow the client to access the user's resources from an external service.

By following this guide you will:

- Create an OAuth2 client in Ory Cloud.
- Run a simple login and consent Node.js application that allows the user to grant or reject access to their data on your machine.
- Configure Ory Cloud to work with the sample application that runs on your machine.
- Perform Authorization Code Grant in Ory Cloud using the login and consent app and a sample web server acting as an OAuth2
  Client.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, prepare your environment:

- [Install Ory CLI](../guides/cli/installation).
- Create an Ory Cloud account and project. Use [Ory CLI](../guides/cli/cli-basics#create-ory-cloud-project) or go to
  [console.ory.sh](https://console.ory.sh/).
- [Install Ory Hydra CLI](../hydra/install).
- [Create a Personal Access Token (PAT)](../concepts/personal-access-token) and save it in a safe place for later use.

## Setup

### Create OAuth2 client in Ory Cloud

Create a new OAuth2 client in Ory Cloud by sending a POST request to the `/admin/clients` API. This is a protected endpoint, which
means that you must include the Ory PAT in the `Authorization` header of the request.

Alternatively, you can use the Ory Hydra CLI and pass your Ory Cloud project slug and the Ory PAT using flags.

:::tip

Learn more about creating OAuth2 clients in Ory Cloud by reading the
[API specification](../reference/api#operation/adminCreateOAuth2Client).

    --callbacks http://127.0.0.1:5555/callback # Mandatory for this example, don't change.
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
````

After you create the client, copy the `client_id` and `client_secret` and save it for later use.

### Run the sample application

Follow these steps to run a sample application with login and consent screens:

1. Clone the [repository with the application](https://github.com/ory/hydra-login-consent-node) and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:ory/hydra-login-consent-node.git
   cd hydra-login-consent-node/
   npm i
   ```

2. Export the Ory PAT and the SDK URL of your Cloud Project as environment variables:

   :::tip

   Don't use previously existing Ory PATs that you use for other purposes. Create a new Ory PAT to use exclusively with the sample
   application.

   :::

   ```bash
   export ORY_PAT=ORY_PAT # Ory PAT copied from the Cloud Console, 'ory_pat' prefix included.
   export HYDRA_ADMIN_URL=SDK_CONFIGURATION_URL  # Found in the 'Connect' section of the Cloud Console.
   ```

3. Start the application on port `3000`:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

When you start the application, go to `http://localhost:3000/` to see the application's welcome page.

:::note

Don't close this terminal window. The application must be running to perform the flow. When working with next parts of this
document, open new terminal windows.

:::

### Configure Ory Cloud

By default, Ory Cloud uses internal redirect URLs for operations such as user login and consent. You can adjust these URLs to
point to pages that handle these operations in your setup. In this example, the sample application runs at
`http://localhost:3000`.

Follow these steps to configure Ory Cloud to call the sample application for login and consent screens:

1. Download the OAuth2 Federation Service configuration of your Ory Cloud project and save it to a `yaml` file:

   ```shell
   ## List all available projects
   ory list projects

   ## Get config
   ory get oauth2-config <project-id> --format yaml > config.yaml
   ```

2. Adjust the configuration in `oauth2/urls/consent` and `oauth2/urls/login`:

   ```yaml title="config.yaml"
     oauth2:
     # ...
       urls:
       // highlight-next-line
         consent: http://localhost:3000/consent
         error: /oauth2/fallbacks/error
       // highlight-next-line
         login: http://localhost:3000/login
         post_logout_redirect: /oauth2/fallbacks/logout
   ```

3. Update the Ory Cloud project configuration using the file you worked with:

   ```shell
   ory update oauth2-config <project-id> --file config.yaml
   ```

### Create a local web server acting as OAuth2 client

Use the Ory Hydra CLI to create a sample web server that acts as the OAuth2 client. To successfully perform the Authorization Code
Grant flow, the client ID and client secret must be registered in Ory Cloud.

Run this command to create the client. Using flags, provide the client ID and secret of the client created in Ory Cloud:

```bash
hydra token user \
    --client-id CLOUD_CLIENT_ID \
    --client-secret CLOUD_CLIENT_SECRET \
    --endpoint SDK_CONFIGURATION_URL \ # Found in the 'Connect' section of the Cloud Console.
    --port 5555 \
    --scope openid,offline
```

When this command runs successfully, a browser window opens automatically and displays a welcome page. If this doesn't happen, go
to `http://127.0.0.1:5555/`.

## Run the flow

After completing the configuration steps, you can start the flow from the welcome page at `http://127.0.0.1:5555/`.

:::tip

The login and consent application at `http://localhost:3000/` shows live logs in its terminal session. Inspecting them can give
you more insight into how this example works.

:::

To execute the flow:

1. In a browser window, go to `http://127.0.0.1:5555/` and click **Authorize application**.
2. On the login screen, provide the user details and log in to proceed.
3. Choose the scopes you want to give the client access to and click **Allow access**. You must choose at least one scope.
4. The next page shows the tokens the client got as a result of running the Authorization Code Grant flow.

   :::note

   You can get a closer look at the `access_token` by decoding it at [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/). In the decoded token, you can find
   information about the user on whose behalf the client acts and the URL of the issuer - your Ory Cloud project.

   :::

By completing the flow and getting the tokens, you successfully granted access to the user's data for the OAuth2 client. If you
think of the example that opens this guide, the goods selling service can now access the user's Google Photos albums and pull
pictures from these albums into listings.
