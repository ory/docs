Ory Elements is a component library designed to make building login, registration, and account pages for Ory quick and easy. Ory
Elements is modular and customizable, which means that you can use only the views you need and style them to match your
implementation's design.

The UI created with Ory Elements changes dynamically to adapt to your Ory Network configuration. For example, the sign-up form
changes to after you edit the Identity Schema without the need for any additional action. The same is true for other options
available in Ory Network, such as social sign-in connections or passwordless login.

The two available examples provide a closer look at integrating Ory Elements with [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) and
[React](https://reactjs.org/) TypeScript single-page applications (SPA). By following the instructions you will:

- Get the example app code from the [Ory Elements repository](https://github.com/ory/elements/).
- Run the application on your machine.
- Use Ory CLI to connect the application running on your machine to your Ory Network project's APIs.
- Have a closer look at the code that's behind the dynamic Ory Elements UI.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure to:

- Create an [Ory Network project](https://console.ory.sh/).
- [Install Ory CLI](../guides/cli/installation) - a tool that will help you connect the app running on your machine to Ory Network
  APIs.

## Run the sample application

Follow these steps to get the sample application code and run it on your machine:

1. Clone the example and prepare the code to run it:

   ````mdx-code-block
   <Tabs groupId="react-or-preact">
     <TabItem value="react" label="React" default>

     ```shell
     git clone --depth 1 git@github.com:ory/elements.git
     cd elements
     npm run initialize
     cd examples/react-spa
     ```

     </TabItem>
     <TabItem value="preact" label="Preact">

     ```shell
     git clone --depth 1 git@github.com:ory/elements.git
     cd elements
     npm run initialize
     cd examples/preact-spa
     ```

     </TabItem>
   </Tabs>
   ````

2. Export environment variable:

   ````mdx-code-block

   <Tabs groupId="react-or-preact">
     <TabItem value="unix" label="Unix systems" default>

   ```shell-session
   export VITE_ORY_SDK_URL=http://localhost:4000
   ```

     </TabItem>
     <TabItem value="powershell" label="Windows Powershell">

   ```powershell
   $Env:VITE_ORY_SDK_URL = "https://{your-project-slug-here}.projects.oryapis.com"
   ```

     </TabItem>
   </Tabs>
   ````

3. Start the application locally:

   ```shell
   # Start the app on port 3000
   npm run dev -- --port 3000
   ```

4. In a new terminal window, run Ory Tunnel (part of the Ory CLI) to connect the application to your Ory Network project:

   ```shell
   # Run Ory Tunnel to connect to Ory APIs.
   # To get your project slug, go to 'Access & APIs' in Ory Console
   # at https://console.ory.sh/

   ory tunnel http://localhost:3000 --project <project-slug> --dev
   ```

5. In your browser, go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to access the application. From there, you can try
   registering and signing-in using the Ory Elements-powered pages.

## Closer look at the code

With the application running, let's have a closer look at the code and the way the application integrates with Ory Elements and
Ory SDK.

### Ory SDK instance

The `sdk.ts` file is responsible for creating a new instance of the Ory SDK. This instance is used to interact with Ory APIs.

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs groupId="react-or-preact">
  <TabItem value="react" label="React" default>

<CodeFromRemote
  lang="ts"
  title="src/sdk.ts"
  src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ory/elements/main/examples/react-spa/src/sdk.ts"
/>

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="preact" label="Preact">

<CodeFromRemote
  lang="ts"
  title="src/sdk.ts"
  src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ory/elements/main/examples/preact-spa/src/sdk.ts"
/>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

### Application entry point

This is the main entry point for the application. This file contains routes and themes for other pages used by the app. The
application is wrapped with Ory Elements using `<ThemeProvider />`. You can change the theme colors by passing in a `Theme` object
to the `themeOverrides` property on the `<ThemeProvider />` component.

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs groupId="react-or-preact">
  <TabItem value="react" label="React" default>

<CodeFromRemote
  lang="tsx"
  title="src/main.tsx"
  src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ory/elements/main/examples/react-spa/src/main.tsx"
/>

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="preact" label="Preact">

<CodeFromRemote
  lang="tsx"
  title="src/main.tsx"
  src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ory/elements/main/examples/preact-spa/src/main.tsx"
/>

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

### Landing page

This file defines the landing page of the application. If you want to protect access to an app, set up authentication to secure
this page. In this case the `Dashboard` component checks if the user has a session and redirects them to the login page if they
don't. We also initialize a logout URL which is necessary for the logout button to work.

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs groupId="react-or-preact">
  <TabItem value="react" label="React" default>

<CodeFromRemote
  lang="tsx"
  title="src/Dashboard.tsx"
  src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ory/elements/main/examples/react-spa/src/Dashboard.tsx"
/>

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="preact" label="Preact">

<CodeFromRemote
  lang="tsx"
  title="src/app.tsx"
  src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ory/elements/main/examples/preact-spa/src/app.tsx"
/>

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

### Login and registration pages

The `login.tsx` and `register.tsx` pages contain components that interact with Ory APIs to allow registering accounts and
performing the login flow.

These pages are dynamic and will show relevant fields based on your Ory Network project configuration. To see the pages change,
edit your project's [Identity Schema](../kratos/manage-identities/identity-schema) or try changing adjusting project settings and
enable [passwordless](../kratos/passwordless/webauthn) flows.

#### Registration

The registration page, defined in the `register.tsx` file:

1. Gets the registration flow (if it exists in the URL) or fallback to start the registration flow to get the `flow` data on page
   load.
2. Submits the registration form data the user provides when they click the **Submit** button,

:::tip

  title="src/register.tsx"
  src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ory/elements/main/examples/preact-spa/src/register.tsx"
/>

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

#### Login

The login page, defined in the `login.tsx` file:

1. Gets the login flow (if it exists in the URL) or falls back to start the registration flow to get the `flow` data on page load.
2. Submits the login form data the user provides when they click the **Submit** button,

  src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ory/elements/main/examples/preact-spa/src/login.tsx"
/>

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

### Settings page

The `settings.tsx` file defines the page of the application where users can change their account settings. This page will also
only render the settings available to the user, an example is enabling passwordless will give the option to add a hardware key,
otherwise it will be omitted. The contents of this page thus change based on your Ory Network project.

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs groupId="react-or-preact">
  <TabItem value="react" label="React" default>

<CodeFromRemote
  lang="tsx"
  title="src/Settings.tsx"
  src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ory/elements/main/examples/react-spa/src/Settings.tsx"
/>

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="preact" label="Preact">

<CodeFromRemote
  lang="tsx"
  title="src/settings.tsx"
  src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ory/elements/main/examples/preact-spa/src/settings.tsx"
/>

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

### Verification page

The `verification.tsx` file defines the page of the application where users verify newly created accounts.

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs groupId="react-or-preact">
  <TabItem value="react" label="React" default>

<CodeFromRemote
  lang="tsx"
  title="src/Verification.tsx"
  src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ory/elements/main/examples/react-spa/src/Verification.tsx"
/>

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="preact" label="Preact">

<CodeFromRemote
  lang="tsx"
  title="src/verification.tsx"
  src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ory/elements/main/examples/preact-spa/src/verification.tsx"
/>

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

### Recovery page

The `recovery.tsx` file defines the page displayed to user that try to recover their accounts after forgetting a password or
losing access to a second authentication factor.

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs groupId="react-or-preact">
  <TabItem value="react" label="React" default>

<CodeFromRemote
  lang="tsx"
  title="src/Recovery.tsx"
  src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ory/elements/main/examples/react-spa/src/Recovery.tsx"
/>

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="preact" label="Preact">

<CodeFromRemote
  lang="tsx"
  title="src/recovery.tsx"
  src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ory/elements/main/examples/preact-spa/src/recovery.tsx"
/>

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
```
