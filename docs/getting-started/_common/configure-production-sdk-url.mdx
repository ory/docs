### Configure your production SDK URL

For production, configure `ORY_SDK_URL` to point to your Ory Network CNAME instead of the `oryapis.com` domain:

```env
# Production configuration
ORY_SDK_URL=https://ory.your-domain.com
```

If you haven't set up a custom domain yet, [add a Custom Domain to your Ory Network project](../../guides/custom-domains.mdx). The CNAME becomes your project's SDK Configuration URL, which you can verify in the [project settings](https://console.ory.sh/projects/current/settings).
