Ory CLI provides a convenient way to configure and manage projects. Additionally, the CLI contains Ory Proxy - a reverse proxy
that rewrites cookies to match the domain your application is currently on.

Ory Proxy is a reverse proxy deployed in front of your application. The Proxy mirrors Ory endpoints on the same domain as the
application you're running and rewrites cookies to match the domain your application is currently on.

As a result, the origin of the cookies is set correctly to the domain you run the app on instead of <br />

```
<your-project-slug>.projects.oryapis.com
```

This behavior is necessary to avoid issues with the browser [CORS policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS).

By using the Proxy, you can easily connect the application you're developing locally to Ory Network and consume the APIs without
the hassle of additional configuration and without the need to self-host any of the Ory Components.
