The Ory security model uses HTTP cookies to manage sessions, tokens, and cookies. Because of browser security measures like
[CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS), Ory APIs must be exposed on the same domain as your application.
In the case of this example the application runs on your local machine. The cookie domain is `localhost`.

:::info

<p>
  Use either `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` consistently. Although technically they refer to the same machine, browsers treat them as
  different cookie domains.
</p>
:::

Ory CLI provides a convenient way to configure and manage projects. Additionally, the CLI provides Ory Tunnel - a tool that
ensures cookies match the domain your application is currently on.

To make Ory APIs and your application available on the same domain, Ory Tunnel mirrors Ory endpoints and rewrites cookies to match
the correct domain. As a result, the domain of the cookies is set correctly to the domain you run the app on instead of
`<your-project-slug>.projects.oryapis.com`.

By using the Tunnel, you can easily connect the application you're developing locally to Ory Network and consume the APIs without
additional configuration or self-hosting any Ory services.

```mdx-code-block
import Mermaid from "@site/src/theme/Mermaid"

<Mermaid
  chart={`graph LR
    B(Browser) -->|GET localhost:4000| T(Ory Tunnel)
    T -->|Response| B
    T <-->|mirrors| API("Ory's APIs")
    B -->|GET localhost:3000| A(Your App)
    A -->|Response| B`}
/>
```
