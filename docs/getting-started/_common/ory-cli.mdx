The Ory security model uses HTTP cookies to manage sessions, tokens, and cookies. Because of browser security measures like
[CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS), Ory APIs must be exposed on the same domain as your application.

In the case of this example the application runs on your local machine. The cookie domain is `localhost`.

:::info

When developing locally, use either `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`, but not both. Although technically these mean the same thing,
they're different cookie domains.

Using both interchangeably in your code causes problems, as Ory APIs will not receive the cookies when they are set on a different
domain.

:::

<p>
  Ory CLI provides a convenient way to configure and manage projects. Additionally, the CLI provides Ory{" "}
  {props.isTunnel ? "Tunnel" : "Proxy"} - a reverse proxy that rewrites cookies to match the domain your application is currently
  on.
</p>

<p>
  To make Ory APIs and your application available on the same domain, Ory {props.isTunnel ? "Tunnel" : "Proxy"} mirrors Ory
  endpoints and rewrites cookies to match the domain correct domain.
</p>

As a result, the domain of the cookies is set correctly to the domain you run the app on instead of
`<your-project-slug>.projects.oryapis.com`.

<p>
  By using the {props.isTunnel ? "Tunnel" : "Proxy"}, you can easily connect the application you're developing locally to Ory
  Network and consume the APIs without additional configuration or the self-hosting any Ory services.
