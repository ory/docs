title: Integrate authentication into Auth.js and NextAuth
sidebar_label: Auth.js / NextAuth
---

This guide covers integrating Ory with Auth.js, a popular authentication library for Next.js applications. Auth.js is a flexible
authentication library that supports multiple authentication providers, including Ory Network out of the box.

Auth.js is the successor to NextAuth.js, which is a popular authentication library for Next.js applications. The Ory provider
works with both Auth.js and NextAuth.js, so you can use either library to integrate Ory with your Next.js application.

To connect your Next.js application with Ory we:

1. Clone an example Next.js application with Auth.js
2. Create an OAuth2 client in Ory and configure Auth.js to use it
3. Perform a demo flow to see the integration in action

Let's get started!

```mdx-code-block
import CodeFromRemote from "@theme/CodeFromRemote"
```

## Clone the example Next.js application

First, clone the example Next.js application with Auth.js:

```shell-session
git clone https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth-example.git
cd next-auth-example
npm i
cp .env.local.example .env.local
npx auth secret
```

In the `auth.ts` file, replace the `providers` array with just Ory:

```mdx-code-block
<CodeFromRemote lang="ts" src="https://github.com/ory/next-auth-example/blob/main/auth.ts" />
```

## Create OAuth2 Client in Ory Network

To create the OAuth2 client, you need to know the redirect URL of your Next.js application. The redirect URL is the URL where Ory
will send the user after they log in. When running NextJS locally, the redirect URL for Auth.js is usually
`http://localhost:3000/auth/callback/ory`.

1. Log into your Ory Network account.
2. create a new project, or select an existing one.
3. Go to ["OAuth 2" -> "Clients"](https://console.ory.sh/projects/current/oauth) and click
   ["Create OAuth 2.0 Client"](https://console.ory.sh/projects/current/oauth/create).
4. Select "Server App".
5. Choose a client name, e.g. "NextAuth Example".
6. Scopes `openid` and `offline_access` are preselected. Add `email` and `profile` to the list.
7. Add redirect URLs for your NextAuth integration. In case of NextJS with Auth.js / Next-Auth, add these two URLs:
   - `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/ory`
   - `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback/ory`
8. Scroll to the bottom and click "Create Client".
9. Copy the Client Secret and click "Done" and save it in your `.env.local` file.
10. Copy the Client ID from the client list and save it in your `.env.local` file.

## Configure Auth.js to use Ory

Your `.env.local` file should now look like this:

```env
# Needed by Auth.js
AUTH_SECRET=...

# Needed for Ory
AUTH_ORY_ID=...
AUTH_ORY_SECRET=...
```

Next, add the Ory Issuer URL to your `.env.local` file. The Issuer URL is the "Ory Network Project API Endpoint" you can find
[here](https://console.ory.sh/projects/current/developers/guides). Unless you have a custom domain set up for your Ory Network
project, it will be in the form of:

```
https://{project.slug}.projects.oryapis.com
```

Your final `.env.local` file should look like this:

```env
# Needed by Auth.js
AUTH_SECRET=...

# Needed for Ory
AUTH_ORY_ID=...
AUTH_ORY_SECRET=...
AUTH_ORY_ISSUER=...
```

## Test the flow

Now everything is set up and you can run `npm run dev` to start the app and click on the top left "Sign in" button to start the
login flow.

## Logout

Log out is performed using OpenID Connect Logout:

```mdx-code-block
<CodeFromRemote lang="js" showLink src="https://github.com/ory/next-auth-example/blob/main/components/auth-components.tsx" showLink={true} startAt="export async function SignOut" />
```

## Go to production

When you are ready to go to production, you need to update the redirect URL in the Ory client settings to the production URL of
your Next.js application.

## Trouble Shooting

### Incorrect `redirect_uri`

If the server responds with

```
The request is missing a required parameter, includes an invalid parameter value, includes a parameter more than once, or is otherwise malformed.
The 'redirect_uri' parameter does not match any of the OAuth 2.0 Client's pre-registered redirect urls.
```

please ensure that the redirect URL is correct. You can find the redirect URL you are sending to Ory by checking the network tab
of your browser and look for calls to `/oauth2/auth`.
