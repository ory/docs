```mdx-code-block
import Teaser from '../_common/teaser.mdx'
import mp4 from '../_static/php/screencast.mp4'
import webm from '../_static/php/screencast.webm'

<Teaser

  mp4={mp4}
  webm={webm}
/>
```

## Create PHP app

First we create a new PHP project:

```shell-session
mkdir your-project
cd your-project
touch index.php
```

## Install dependencies

To interact with Ory's APIs we install the [Ory SDK](https://packagist.org/packages/ory/client):

```shell-session
composer require ory/client:^v0.0.1-alpha
```

To simplify URLs handling we install the [bramus/router](https://packagist.org/packages/bramus/router)

```shell-session
composer require bramus/router
```

To install Ory CLI follow [this guide](https://www.ory.sh/docs/guides/ory-cli-install-use)

### Why do I Need the Ory CLI?

```mdx-code-block
import OryCLI from '../_common/ory-cli.mdx'

<OryCLI />
```

## Create an Entry Page

This is a working example of basic `index.php` script which creates an Ory client, registers new route for our Dashboard and makes
use of [Before Route Middlewares](https://github.com/bramus/router#before-router-middlewares) to validate if the user is allowed
to view the Dashboard.

```mdx-code-block title="index.php"
import indexPHP from '!!raw-loader!../../../code-examples/protect-page-login/php/index.php'
import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock'

<CodeBlock language="php">{indexPHP}</CodeBlock>
```

## Validate and login

Next we will create handler which will check with your Ory project if the user has a valid session. Notice here that we are taking
the current `request` cookies and passing them along to the Ory client.

If the session is not valid the request is redirected to the Ory project for login. At this point we have not set up any custom UI
management and thus will be shown the Ory Account Experience login page.

For the last part we need to add the Dashboard handler (the page we would like to protect) which will render an HTML with the
session data.

This is accomplished by the simple `App` class stored in the `app.php` file:

```mdx-code-block title="app.php"
import appPHP from '!!raw-loader!../../../code-examples/protect-page-login/php/app.php'

<CodeBlock language="php">{appPHP}</CodeBlock>
```

## Run your app

Start your HTTP server and access the proxy URL

```shell-session
php -S 127.0.0.1:3000
```

```mdx-code-block
import SdkEnvVar from '@site/src/components/SdkEnvVar'

<SdkEnvVar />
```

```shell-session
ory proxy http://localhost:3000
```

To access the PHP app through the ORY proxy open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) in your browser. You are presented
with Ory's Sign In page. Let's click on sign up and create your first user.

## Go to production

```mdx-code-block
import ToProd from '../_common/going-to-prod.mdx'

<ToProd />
```

```php
$config = Ory\Client\Configuration::getDefaultConfiguration()->setHost("https://ory.example.org"));
$ory = new Ory\Client\Api\V0alpha2Api(new GuzzleHttp\Client(), $config);
```
