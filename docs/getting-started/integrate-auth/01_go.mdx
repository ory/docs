## Create Go app

First, create a Go app. Run these commands:

```shell
mkdir your-project
cd your-project

touch main.go handler.go middleware.go index.html
go mod init github.com/<your-name>/your-project
```

## Install Ory SDK

Run this command to install the Ory SDK which allows you to interact with Ory APIs:

```mdx-code-block
<CodeBlock className="language-shell">{`go get github.com/ory/client-go@${useLatestTag('client-go', 'master')}`}</CodeBlock>
```

## Create a new Ory project

```mdx-code-block
import CreateProject from '../_common/create-project.mdx'

<CreateProject />
```

## Install Ory CLI

Follow [this guide](../../guides/cli/01_installation.mdx) to install the Ory CLI on your machine.

### Why do I need the Ory CLI

```mdx-code-block
import OryCLI from '../_common/ory-cli.mdx'

<OryCLI />
```

## Create HTTP server

Use this code to set up a basic server that creates an Ory client, registers a new route for the Go app and uses middleware to
validate if the user is allowed to access the application.

Add the code to the `main.go` file:

```mdx-code-block
import mainGo from '!!raw-loader!../../../code-examples/protect-page-login/go/main.go'

<CodeBlock language="go" title="./main.go">{mainGo}</CodeBlock>
```

## Validate and login

Next, create middleware that checks if the user has a valid session. The session is considered valid when the user is
authenticated.

To create the middleware, add the code to the `middleware.go` file:

```mdx-code-block
import middlewareGo from '!!raw-loader!../../../code-examples/protect-page-login/go/middleware.go'

<CodeBlock language="go" title="./middleware.go">{middlewareGo}</CodeBlock>
```

The middleware passes the current `request` cookies to the Ory client to check if the session is valid.

If the session is valid, the user is presented with the protected page. When the session is not valid, which means that the user
is not authenticated or the session expired, the request is redirected for login using the Ory Account Experience.

## The protected page

As the final step, create a `Dashboard` page that's presented to signed-in users. This page diplays the user's session data.

To create the `dashboardHandler` that renders the page with the session data, add this code to the `handler.go` file:

```mdx-code-block
import handlerGo from '!!raw-loader!../../../code-examples/protect-page-login/go/handler.go'

<CodeBlock language="go" title="./handler.go">{handlerGo}</CodeBlock>
```

## Test your application

With all of the pieces in place, it's time to test your application. Follow these steps:

1. Start your Go app:

```shell
go run .
```

2. Run the Ory Tunnel to mirror the Ory API endpoints on your application's domain (`localhost`). Upon first start, the Ory Tunnel
   will ask you to log into your Ory Console account.

```shell
npx @ory/cli tunnel --dev http://localhost:3000
```

3. Open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) to access the application. Since the initial call is made by an
   unauthenticated user, the middleware doesn't detect a valid session and redirects to the login page of the defined Ory project.
   <br /> <br /> From there, you can create a new account or sign in using an existing identity. When you sign in, the session
   becomes valid and the application shows the `Dashboard` page with the session data.

## Go to production

```mdx-code-block
import ToProd from '../_common/going-to-prod.mdx'

<ToProd />
```

```go
// register a new Ory client with the URL set to the custom domain
// we can also read the URL from the env or a config file
c := ory.NewConfiguration()
c.Servers = ory.ServerConfigurations{{URL: "https://ory.example.org"}}
```
