```

## Create Go App

First, create a Go app. Run these commands:

```shell-session
mkdir your-project
cd your-project

touch main.go handler.go middleware.go index.html
go mod init github.com/<your-name>/your-project
```

## Install Ory SDK

Run this command to install the Ory SDK which allows you to interact with Ory APIs:

```shell-session
go get -u github.com/ory/client-go
```

## Install Ory CLI

Follow [this guide](../../guides/cli/01_installation.mdx) to install the Ory CLI on your machine.

### Why do I Need the Ory CLI?

```mdx-code-block
import OryCLI from '../_common/ory-cli.mdx'

<OryCLI />
```

## Create HTTP Server

Use this code to set up a basic server that creates an Ory client, registers a new route for the Go app and uses middleware to
validate if the user is allowed to access the application.

Add the code to the `main.go` file:

```mdx-code-block title="main.go"
import mainGo from '!!raw-loader!../../../code-examples/protect-page-login/go/main.go'
import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock'

<CodeBlock language="go">{mainGo}</CodeBlock>
```

## Validate and Login

Next, create middleware that checks if the user has a valid session. The session is considered valid when the user is
authenticated.

The middleware passes the current `request` cookies to the Ory client to check if the session is valid.

If the session is valid, the user is presented with the protected page. When the session is not valid, which means that the user
is not authenticated or the session expired, the request is redirected for login using the Ory Managed UI.

To create the middleware, add the code to the `middleware.go` file:

```mdx-code-block title="middleware.go"
import middlewareGo from '!!raw-loader!../../../code-examples/protect-page-login/go/middleware.go'

<CodeBlock language="go">{middlewareGo}</CodeBlock>
```

## The protected page

As the final step, create a `Dashboard` page that's presented to signed-in users. This page diplays the user's session data.

1. Create the `dashboardHandler` that renders the page with the session data. Add this code to the `handler.go` file:

```mdx-code-block title="handler.go"
import handlerGo from '!!raw-loader!../../../code-examples/protect-page-login/go/handler.go'

<CodeBlock language="go">{handlerGo}</CodeBlock>
```

2. To present the data to the user, create the `Dashboard` HTML page. Add this code to the `index.html` file:

```mdx-code-block title="index.html"
import index from '!!raw-loader!../../../code-examples/protect-page-login/go/index.html'

<CodeBlock language="html">{index}</CodeBlock>
```

## Test your application

With all of the pieces in place, it's time to test your application. Follow these steps:

1. Start your Go app:

```shell-session
 go run .
```

2. Export the SDK configuration URL for the desired Ory project. You can use the provided playground project for testing, or
   export the SDK URL of your own Ory Cloud project.

:::info

To get your project's SDK URL, sign in at [console.ory.sh](https://console.ory.sh/), select **Connect** from the left navigation
panel, and copy the URL from the **SDK Configuration** section.

:::

```mdx-code-block
import SdkEnvVar from '@site/src/components/SdkEnvVar'

<SdkEnvVar />
```

3. Run the Ory proxy to mirror the Ory API endpoints on your application's domain (`localhost`):

```shell-session
ory proxy http://localhost:3000
```

4. Open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) to access the application. As the initial call is made by an
   unauthenticated user, the middleware doesn't detect a valid session and redirects to the login page of the defined Ory project.
   <br /> <br /> From there, you can create a new account or sign in using an existing identity. When you sign in, the session
   becomes valid and the application shows the `Dashboard` page with the session data.

## Go to Production

```mdx-code-block
import ToProd from '../_common/going-to-prod.mdx'

<ToProd />
```

```go
// register a new Ory client with the URL set to the Ory CLI Proxy
// we can also read the URL from the env or a config file
c := ory.NewConfiguration()
c.Servers = ory.ServerConfigurations{{URL: "https://ory.example.org"}}
```
