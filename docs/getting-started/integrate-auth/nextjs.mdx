## Create Next.js app

First we create a new Next.js project:

```shell-session
npx create-next-app@12.1 --typescript
cd <your-project-directory>
```

### Install Ory

Ory provides integration tools that quickly combine Ory with Next.js. Let's install Ory's SDK, used to make API calls to Ory, and
Ory's Integration Tools for JavaScript frameworks:

```shell-session
npm i --save @ory/integrations @ory/client
```

and create a special route in `[...paths].js` at `pages/api/.ory/`.

```mdx-code-block
import apiRoute12 from '!!raw-loader!../../../code-examples/protect-page-login/nextjs-12/pages/api/.ory/\[...paths\].ts'

<CodeBlock language="tsx">{apiRoute12}</CodeBlock>
```

:::tip

This route from ory/integrations works in a similar way as ory tunnel, read more about it
[here](https://www.ory.sh/docs/guides/cli/proxy-and-tunnel). It is only required when developing locally. It can be removed when
going to production with a custom domain. More details in the "Go to production" section above.

:::

This route connects your Next.js app with Ory's APIs and ensures that all cookies and credentials are set up. Without it, your
Next.js application won't be able to talk to Ory's APIs.

### Require login to access the home page

Next we add a session check to the default home page of the Next.js example application.The highlighted code is what we added to
check whether the user is signed in, and redirect them to the login page if not:

```mdx-code-block
import homePage12 from '!!raw-loader!../../../code-examples/protect-page-login/nextjs-12/pages/index.tsx'

<CodeBlock language="tsx">{homePage12}</CodeBlock>
```

### Run your Next.js app

Great, that's it. Let's run your application. Set up your environment variables to connect with Ory's APIs

```mdx-code-block
import SdkEnvVar12 from '@site/src/components/SdkEnvVar'

<SdkEnvVar12 />
```

and start the Next.js development server:

```shell-session
npm run dev
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser. are presented with Ory's Sign In page. Let's click on
sign up and create your first user.

  </TabItem>

## Create Next.js app

First we create a new Next.js project:

```shell-session
npx create-next-app@latest --typescript
cd <your-project-directory>
```

`create-next-app` Settings used in this tutorial:

```
✔ Would you like to use ESLint with this project? … Yes
✔ Would you like to use `src/` directory with this project? … Yes
✔ Would you like to use experimental `app/` directory with this project? … No
✔ What import alias would you like configured? … @
```

import apiRoute from '!!raw-loader!../../../code-examples/protect-page-login/nextjs/src/pages/api/.ory/\[...paths\].ts'

<CodeBlock language="tsx">{apiRoute}</CodeBlock>

### Run your Next.js app

Great, that's it. Let's run your application. Set up your environment variables to connect with Ory's APIs

```shell-session
export NEXT_PUBLIC_ORY_SDK_URL="https://<your-ory-project>.projects.oryapis.com"
```

and start the Next.js development server:

```shell-session
npm run dev
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser. are presented with Ory's Sign In page. Let's click on
sign up and create your first user.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Go to production

When upgrading to production, you need to set up a custom domain and configure your Next.js app to use it. Once you have
configured a custom domain and deployed your application the integrations package is no longer needed:

````diff
- import { edgeConfig } from "@ory/integrations/next"
- const ory = new FrontendApi(new Configuration(edgeConfig))
+ const basePath = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ORY_SDK_URL;

+ const ory = new FrontendApi(
+   new Configuration({
+     basePath: basePath,
+     baseOptions: {
+       withCredentials: true,
+     },
+   })
+ );

...

- return router.push(edgeConfig.basePath + "/ui/login")
+ return router.push(basePath + "/ui/login");

...
```

You can now also remove the `pages/api/.ory/` route.

Release your app bundled with Ory to production using:

```mdx-code-block
import VercelDeploy from '@site/src/components/VercelDeploy'

<VercelDeploy />
````
