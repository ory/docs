## Create Flutter Web app

Run this command to create a basic Flutter application:

```shell-session
flutter create myapp
cd myapp
```

Add [dio](https://github.com/flutterchina/dio) and [flutter dotenv](https://github.com/java-james/flutter_dotenv) to your
`pubspec.yaml` file.

We use [dio](https://github.com/flutterchina/dio) for HTTP request and
[flutter dotenv](https://github.com/java-james/flutter_dotenv) for environment variable management.

```mdx-code-block
import pubspec from '!!raw-loader!../../../code-examples/protect-page-login/flutter_web_redirect/pubspec.yaml'
import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock'

<CodeBlock language="yaml" title="pubspec.yaml">{pubspec}</CodeBlock>
```

## Install Ory CLI

Follow [this guide](../../guides/cli/01_installation.mdx) to install the Ory CLI on your machine.

### Why do I Need the Ory CLI?

```mdx-code-block
import OryCLI from '../_common/ory-cli.mdx'

<OryCLI />
```

## Create the authentication service

Next, create an Authentication service in the `lib/services` directory. This service will be used to query the Ory APIs for
session information.

```shell-session
mkdir lib/services && touch lib/services/auth.dart
```

```mdx-code-block
import auth from '!!raw-loader!../../../code-examples/protect-page-login/flutter_web_redirect/lib/services/auth.dart'

<CodeBlock language="dart" title="lib/services/auth.dart">{auth}</CodeBlock>
```

## Add environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project to hold the `ORY_BASE_URL` variable. The value of the variable is the Ory proxy
URL, for example `http://localhost:3005`.

```shell-session
touch .env
```

```mdx-code-block
import env from '!!raw-loader!../../../code-examples/protect-page-login/flutter_web_redirect/env'

<CodeBlock language="text" title=".env">{env}</CodeBlock>
```

## Update lib/main.dart

Finally, update the `lib/main.dart` file to check for a session cookie on the initial load of the application. If the cookie is
found, the user can access the application. If the cookie isn't found, the user is redirected to the login page.

```mdx-code-block
import main from '!!raw-loader!../../../code-examples/protect-page-login/flutter_web_redirect/lib/main.dart'

<CodeBlock language="dart" title="lib/main.dart">{main}</CodeBlock>
```

## Test you application

Run the following steps to get your application running:

1. Start your flutter web server

```shell-session
flutter run -d web-server --web-port 4005
```

2. Export the SDK configuration URL for the desired Ory project. You can use the provided playground project for testing, or
   export the SDK URL of your own project.

:::info

To get your project's SDK URL, go to <ConsoleLink route="project.settings" />, and copy the URL from the **API Endpoints** field.

:::

```mdx-code-block
import SdkEnvVar from '@site/src/components/SdkEnvVar'

<SdkEnvVar />
```

3. Run the Ory tunnel to expose Ory API under the same top-level domain as your application (`localhost`):

```shell-session
ory tunnel --port 3005 http://localhost:4005
```

4. Open [http://localhost:4005](http://localhost:4005) to access the application. As the initial call is made by an
   unauthenticated user, the session check doesn't detect a valid session and redirects to the login page of the defined Ory
   project. <br/> <br/> From there, you can create a new account or sign in using an existing identity. When you sign in, the
   session becomes valid and the application shows the `Home` page with the session data.

## Go to production

```mdx-code-block
import ToProd from '../_common/going-to-prod.mdx'

<ToProd />
```

### Release build

With the `flutter` cli we can build a release version of our App by running the command below:

```shell-session
flutter build web
```

We then need an HTTP server to serve the files, we will use [dhttpd](https://pub.dev/packages/dhttpd).

```shell-session
dhttpd --host localhost --port 4005 --path build/web
```
