```mdx-code-block
import Teaser from '../_common/teaser.mdx'
import mp4 from '../_static/php/screencast.mp4'
import webm from '../_static/php/screencast.webm'

<Teaser
  framework={<a href="https://www.php.net/">PHP</a>}
  mp4={mp4}
  webm={webm}
/>
```

## Create PHP app

First we create a new PHP project:

```shell
mkdir your-project
cd your-project
touch index.php
```

## Install dependencies

To interact with Ory's APIs we install the [Ory SDK](https://packagist.org/packages/ory/client):

```shell
composer require ory/client
```

To simplify URLs handling we install the [bramus/router](https://packagist.org/packages/bramus/router)

```shell
composer require bramus/router
```

## Create a new Ory project

```mdx-code-block
import CreateProject from '../_common/create-project.mdx'

<CreateProject />
```

## Install Ory CLI

To install Ory CLI follow [this guide](https://www.ory.sh/docs/guides/ory-cli-install-use)

### Why do I need the Ory CLI

```mdx-code-block
import OryCLI from '../_common/ory-cli.mdx'

<OryCLI />
```

## Create an Entry Page

Create a new file called `index.php` and paste the following code:

```mdx-code-block
import indexPHP from '!!raw-loader!../../../code-examples/protect-page-login/php/index.php'
import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock'

<CodeBlock language="php" title="./index.php">{indexPHP}</CodeBlock>
```

This entry script creates an Ory client, registers new route for our Dashboard and makes use of
[Before Route Middlewares](https://github.com/bramus/router#before-router-middlewares) to validate if the user is allowed to view
the Dashboard.

We are yet to create an App class, let's do that now.

## Validate and login

Create a new file called `app.php` and paste the following code:

```mdx-code-block
import appPHP from '!!raw-loader!../../../code-examples/protect-page-login/php/app.php'

<CodeBlock language="php" title="app.php">{appPHP}</CodeBlock>
```

Create a handler that checks with your Ory project to determine if the user has a valid session. We take the current `request`
cookies and pass them to the Ory client.

This file validates the session and redirects to the login page if the session is invalid. If the session is not valid, the
request is redirected to the Ory project for login. At this stage, we have not set up any custom UI management, so the Ory Account
Experience login page will be displayed.

Finally, we added the Dashboard handler (the page we want to protect), which will render HTML with the session data.

## Run your app

Start your HTTP server and access the tunnel URL

```shell
php -S 127.0.0.1:3000
```

Next open a new terminal window and start the Ory Tunnel. Upon first start, the Ory Tunnel will ask you to log into your Ory
Console account.

```shell
ory tunnel --project <PROJECT_ID> http://localhost:3000
```

To access the PHP app through the Ory Tunnel, open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) in your browser. You are
presented with Ory's Sign In page. Let's click on sign up and create your first user.

## Go to production

```mdx-code-block
import ToProd from '../_common/going-to-prod.mdx'

<ToProd />
```

```php
$config = Ory\Client\Configuration::getDefaultConfiguration()->setHost("https://ory.example.org"));
$ory = new Ory\Client\Api\FrontendApi(new GuzzleHttp\Client(), $config);
```
