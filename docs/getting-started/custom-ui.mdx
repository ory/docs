Are you looking for an example on how to build a custom user interface for Ory Identities? Fork the pre-built user interfaces!

```mdx-code-block
import ExampleList from "@site/src/components/Examples/example-list"
import * as content from "@site/src/pages/_assets/examples-content"

<ExampleList {...content.customui} />
```
