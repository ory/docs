Are you looking for an example on how to build a custom user interface for Ory Identities or the Ory Kratos Identity Server? Fork
these pre-built user interfaces!

It is recommended to read the [custom user interface documentation](../kratos/bring-your-own-ui/01_overview.mdx) before you start
coding.

```mdx-code-block
import ExampleList from "@site/src/components/Examples/example-list"
import * as content from "@site/src/pages/_assets/examples-content"

<ExampleList {...content.customui} />
```
