To create your first project on the Ory Network, install the Ory CLI:

```mdx-code-block
import Install from '@site/docs/_common/install-cli.mdx'

<Install />
```

and create your first project (it's free):

```shell
ory create project --name "Documentation example"
```

Once the project is created, you have access to Ory's APIs.

## Ory APIs

```mdx-code-block
import ApiTypes from '../api/_common/api-types.mdx'

<ApiTypes />
```

For a full reference of APIs check out the [REST and gRPC](../keto/reference/proto-api.mdx) API documentation.

### API Keys

API Keys are used to authorize privileged operations. For example, you must use an API Key to call the Admin API, which allows you
to delete users. You can create API Keys in the Ory Console.

Follow these steps:

1. Go to <ConsoleLink route="project.developers" />.
2. Click **Create new API key**
3. Enter the API Key name and click **Create**
4. Copy the created API Key

## Environments

Ory Network offers different environments for production, staging, and development. These are called Ory Network projects.

Review rate limits in the [Project Rate Limits](https://www.ory.sh/docs/guides/rate-limits) documentation. To match configuration
between projects use the [Ory CLI](https://www.ory.sh/docs/guides/cli/config-with-cli) For more information what environments are
included on the Ory Network plans, head over to the [Pricing](https://ory.sh/pricing) page.

Staging and development projects are for test data only! Ory Network doesn't guarantee GDPR-compliant PII handling in staging and
development projects.

### Development projects

Development projects provide a free test environment for your projects, with limited rate limits and no custom domain. They are
ideal for early-stage development and testing. To create a new development project, use the following command:

```shell
ory create project --name "My Development Project"
```

### Staging projects

Staging projects offer all features of production environment including a custom domain (e.g.,
`https://auth-staging.example.com`). Staging projects have lower rate limits than production projects.

To create a new staging project, open the [Ory Console](https://console.ory.sh/projects/create), hit "Create new project", and
select the Staging environment in the next screen.

Staging projects are suitable for testing your application and its integrations with Ory Network before deploying to production.
They provide a more accurate representation of how your application will behave in a production project compared to development
projects, without the risk of affecting real users or data.

## Local development

To make login easy and secure, Ory uses cookies to manage session in browser applications. Ory additionally deploys CSRF cookies
to protect against CSRF attacks. We recommend taking a deep-dive into [Ory's security model](../security-model.mdx) if you are not
familiar with the concepts.

Ory also supports advanced SSO capabilities based on OpenID Connect. For system that do not require an enterprise SSO solution, we
recommend sticking to session cookies.

When developing locally, your application is often exposed at the `localhost` domain. Ory APIs must be available on the same
domain (so `localhost`) as your application to avoid issues with third-party cookie (e.g. when using Ory Session Cookies). The
easiest way to expose Ory on your `localhost` domain is to use the [Ory CLI Tunnel](../guides/cli/20_proxy-and-tunnel.mdx).

Copy the project slug from your project's [Connect page](https://console.ory.sh/projects/current/connect) and start the Ory
Tunnel. Here we assume that your app runs on `http://localhost:3000`:

```shell
ory tunnel --dev --project $PROJECT_SLUG \
  http://localhost:3000
```

Running this commands opens the `4000` port on your local machine. The URL `http://localhost:3000` is where your application is
available. The `--dev` flag disables a few security checks to make local development easier. After starting the Tunnel, test it by
performing the registration flow: [`http://localhost:4000/ui/registration`](http://localhost:4000/ui/registration).

You can now start developing locally. Make sure to send any HTTP calls you make to `http://localhost:4000` and not
`https://{your-slug}.projects.oryapis.com`. For example, when you configure the Ory SDK (here in Node.js):

```typescript
import { Configuration, FrontendApi } from "@ory/client"

const frontend = new FrontendApi(
  new Configuration({
    // Replace
    //  basePath: "https://$PROJECT_SLUG.projects.oryapis.com",
    // with
    basePath: "http://localhost:4000",
    baseOptions: {
      withCredentials: true,
    },
  }),
)

const { data: login } = await frontend.createBrowserLoginFlow()
const { data: session } = await frontend.toSession()
// ...
```

Only the `FrontendApi` needs to access the Ory Tunnel. Administrative APIs like `IdentityApi` can be accessed directly from your
project slug, although they also work via the Ory Tunnel.

### Limitations

Using the Ory Tunnel has two key limitations currently.

- Your local machine is usually available on both `localhost` and `127.0.0.1`. For the browser these two domains are different
  domains. Cookies set on `localhost` will not be sent in requests to `127.0.0.1` and vice versa. If you encounter cookie issues,
  make sure that all of your requests are sent to `localhost` and not `127.0.0.1`.
- [WebAuthn](../kratos/mfa/webauthn-fido-yubikey) does not support cross-domain use currently. We are working together with the
  [W3C to figure out solutions](https://github.com/w3c/webauthn/issues/1372).
