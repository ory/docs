To create your first project on the Ory Network, install the Ory CLI

```mdx-code-block
import Install from '@site/docs/_common/install-cli.mdx'

<Install />
```

and create your first project (it's free):

```shell
ory create project --name "Documentation example"
```

Once the project is created, you have access to Ory's APIs.

## API

```mdx-code-block
import ApiTypes from '../api/_common/api-types.mdx'

<ApiTypes />
```

For a full reference of APIs check out the [REST and gRPC](../keto/reference/proto-api.mdx) API documentation.

### API Keys

API Keys are used to authenticate privileged requests to the Ory backend APIs. You can create API Keys in the Ory Cloud Console.
Head over to the Ory Console [API key page](https://console.ory.sh/projects/current/connect).

## Local Development

To make login easy and secure, Ory uses cookies to manage session in browser applications. Ory additionally deploys CSRF cookies
to protect against CSRF attacks. We recommend taking a deep-dive into [Ory's security model](../security-model.mdx) if you are not
familiar with the concepts.

Ory also supports advanced SSO capabilities based on OpenID Connect. For system that do not require an enterprise SSO solution, we
recommend sticking to session cookies.

When developing locally, your application is often exposed at the `localhost` domain. Ory APIs must be available on the same
domain (so `localhost`) as your application to avoid issues with third-party cookie (e.g. when using Ory Session Cookies). The
easiest way to expose Ory on your `localhost` domain is to use the [Ory CLI Tunnel](../guides/cli/20_proxy-and-tunnel.mdx).

Copy the project slug from your project's [Connect page](https://console.ory.sh/projects/current/connect) and start the Ory
Tunnel. Here we assume that your app runs on `http://localhost:3000`:

```shell
ory tunnel --dev --project {project.id-or-project.slug} \
  http://localhost:3000
```

Running this commands opens the `4000` port on your local machine. The URL `http://localhost:3000` is where your application is
available. The `--dev` flag disables a few security checks to make local development easier. After starting the Tunnel, test it by
performing the registration flow: [`http://localhost:4000/ui/registration`](http://localhost:4000/ui/registration).

You can now start developing locally. Make sure to send any HTTP calls you make to `http://localhost:4000` and not
`https://<your-slug>.projects.oryapis.com`. For example, when you configure the Ory SDK (here in Node.js):

```typescript
import { Configuration, FrontendApi } from "@ory/client"

const frontend = new FrontendApi(
  new Configuration({
    // Replace
    //  basePath: "https://{project.slug}.projects.oryapis.com",
    // with
    basePath: "http://localhost:4000",
    baseOptions: {
      withCredentials: true,
    },
  }),
)

const { data: login } = await frontend.createBrowserLoginFlow()
const { data: session } = await frontend.toSession()
// ...
```

Only the `FrontendApi` needs to access the Ory Tunnel. Administrative APIs like `IdentityApi` can be accessed directly from your
project slug, although they also work via the Ory Tunnel.

### Limitations

Using the Ory Tunnel has two key limitations currently.

First, your local machine is usually available on both `localhost` and `127.0.0.1`. For the browser these two domains are
different top-level-domains. Cookies set on `localhost` will not be sent in requests to `127.0.0.1` and vice versa. If you
encounter cookie issues, make sure that all of your requests are sent to `localhost` and not `127.0.0.1`.

Second, [WebAuthn](../kratos/mfa/webauthn-fido-yubikey) does not support cross-domain use. We are working together with the
[W3C to figure out solutions](https://github.com/w3c/webauthn/issues/1372).
