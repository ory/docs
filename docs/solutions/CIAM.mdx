Ory abstracts away the complexity of secure authentication flows, session management, token handling, and credential storage.
Instead of implementing password hashing, OAuth2 flows, CSRF protection, and session invalidation yourself, you integrate with
Ory's APIs. 

Ory's CIAM stack includes:

- Ory Kratos — identity management (registration, login, password reset, profile management, MFA, social sign-in, passkeys) 

- Ory Hydra — OAuth2 and OpenID Connect server for token-based API authorization 

- Ory Keto — fine-grained, relationship-based access
control (permissions) 

- Ory Oathkeeper — identity-aware API gateway that validates sessions and tokens

You define identity schemas (what data you store about users), configure authentication methods (password, social, passwordless),
and set authorization policies (who can access what). Ory handles the flow lifecycle, session management, and token handling. You
integrate via SDKs or REST APIs, and Ory's self-service flows mean users handle their own registration, login, and recovery
without you building custom UIs.

## Why Ory for CIAM? 

Building auth correctly is hard! Subtle bugs create security vulnerabilities. Ory provides battle-tested,
open-source implementations you can self-host or run as a managed service (Ory Network), so your team focuses on your product, not
reinventing login screens.
