Workforce IAM handles authentication and authorization for your internal users — employees, contractors, and partners 
who need secure access to internal applications, tools, and resources. Unlike CIAM where you control the full identity 
lifecycle, workforce scenarios often require integrating with existing corporate identity providers, enforcing 
compliance policies, and managing access across a mix of internal and third-party applications. Ory's stack supports 

Workforce IAM patterns:

- Ory Kratos: manages employee identities, authentication flows (login, MFA, password reset, account management), and 
supports federation with existing corporate identity providers via OIDC and SAML so employees use their existing 
credentials.

- Ory Hydra: provides OAuth2/OIDC for single sign-on across internal applications and secure machine-to-machine 
communication between internal services.

- Ory Keto: enforces role-based and relationship-based access control across internal tools and resources. Model 
organizational structures (user X belongs to department Y, department Y has access to application Z) and enforce 
least-privilege access policies.

- Ory Polis: federates with corporate identity providers via SAML 2.0 and OIDC, enabling employees to authenticate with 
existing enterprise credentials. Supports directory sync via SCIM for automated onboarding and offboarding as employees 
join, move between teams, or leave the organization.

- Ory Oathkeeper: acts as an identity-aware gateway for internal services, validating employee sessions and enforcing 
access policies before requests reach backend applications.

Key Workforce IAM patterns Ory supports include single sign-on across internal applications, integration with existing 
corporate identity providers (Active Directory, Okta, Google Workspace), automated provisioning and deprovisioning via 
SCIM directory sync, role-based access control aligned to organizational structure, MFA enforcement for sensitive 
resources, and session policies that adapt to compliance requirements.

## Why Ory for Workforce IAM? 

Employee onboarding and offboarding is a security-critical process — orphaned accounts and 
stale permissions are among the most common attack vectors in enterprise breaches. Building SSO federation and 
directory sync yourself means months of SAML XML parsing, SCIM endpoint implementation, and lifecycle management logic. 
Ory provides the identity federation, provisioning, and access control infrastructure to secure your workforce while 
integrating with the corporate identity systems your organization already uses.
