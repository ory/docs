Ory is an open source ecosystem and a cloud offering authentication,
authorization, access control, and delegation (OAuth2 & OpenID Connect) services
and APIs:

- [Ory Cloud](https://console.ory.sh) is a cloud service built on top of Ory
  Open Source.
- Ory Open Source offers scalable and hardened security software:
- [Ory Kratos](https://github.com/ory/kratos)
- [Ory Hydra](https://github.com/ory/hydra)
- [Ory Oathkeeper](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper)
- [Ory Keto](https://github.com/ory/keto)

Some parts of Ory are actively being developed. To learn more about roadmap and
planned features head over to [the roadmap](./ecosystem/roadmap.md) and
[project maturity](./ecosystem/versioning.md).

## Why Ory is Different

Ory differentiates from other vendors in the following key areas:

- Our core services and APIs are developed and licensed under Apache 2.0,
  allowing you to participate, collaborate, and understand the inner workings of
  Ory.
- You can bring your own UI, in the programming language of your choosing, with
  the user experience that you like.
- From designing Identity Schemas using JSON Schema, to webhooks, to advanced
  configuration options - Ory is the most customizable platform out there.
- Ory spans the whole authentication and authorization universe with
  well-designed products and APIs:
- Identity Management with session management, flows for login, registration,
  account recovery & verification, mfa, and many more.
- Permission and Role Management.
- Delegation via OAuth2 and OpenID Connect.
- Zero Trust Networking.
- Modern API design with partial support for gRPC.

## Ory Cloud

Ory Cloud is the commercial offering of Ory and is built on top of our popular
open source software. Our goal with Ory Cloud is to offer a planet-scale,
low-latency, resilient, and secure service that is easy to use and set up.

In short: Ory Cloud is the most convenient and straightforward way to run Ory.

### Components

The Ory Cloud uses a variety of components - some are based on open source
projects and others are closed source.

### Console

The Ory Console is the management UI of the Ory Cloud. It offers capabilities
such as showing and searching for identities, managing user sessions, and
gaining valuable insights in the form of dashboards and customization.

### Managed UI

The Managed UI implements screens such as login, registration, account recovery,
account setting, and account verification. This allows for fast adoption of Ory.

Contrary to other vendors, Ory allows you to implement your own (login,
registration, ...) UI by offering simple, headless APIs.

### Identity & Session Services

Ory Cloud incorporates the open source [Ory Kratos](https://www.ory.sh/kratos)
project and offers:

- **Self-service** flows are everything users do on their own / without the help
  of others:
- Registration with passwords, social sign in, OpenID Connect, ...
- Login with passwords, social sign in, OpenID Connect, ...
- Updating the profile, email, changing the password, un/linking with Social.
  Sign In providers, ...
- Recovering the account by resetting the password.
- Verifying email addresses, phone numbers, ....
- Multi-factor authentication flows and recovery processes.
- **Administrative identity management** to get, create, update, delete
  identities (users) and their data.
- **Headless APIs and data models** allow you to fully customize Identity
  Schemas (e.g. adding fields like first name, accept tos, shipping address,
  gender, ...) and create your own login, registration, profile settings,
  recovery, and verification screen using our easy to use SDKs and REST APIs.

## Ory Open Source

Ory is the largest open source ecosystem in the area of authentication,
authorization, access control, and zero trust networking in the world. Ory is
not another company "greenwashing" with open source by publishing SDKs under
open source licenses. Instead, all of our core systems are available as Apache
2.0 licensed software without enterprise or open core models.

Head over to the [Ory Open Source Overview](./open-source.mdx) for an
introduction to the different projects.

### Is Open Source Taking a Back Seat?

**No!** Ory Cloud is our commercial offering with which we generate revenue to
build more open source and more features in Ory Cloud. Our value proposition and
vision for Ory Cloud is to incorporate and advance the open source ecosystem and
add additional services which are not possible to open source (e.g. Analytics,
SLAs, SRE, Low-Latency).

Ory Cloud and our open source software are interlinked. While we have made some
modifications to the open source to make it work better in our multi-tenant
environment and operational (SRE) model, we are using the same code base, APIs,
features, and configurations for the Ory Cloud.

In the future, we will increase our open source footprint, make the projects
easier to modify, use, access, and distribute. The only impact Ory Cloud will
have is that it will accelerate development and enable us to spend more
resources on the open source!
