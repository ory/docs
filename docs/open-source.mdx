title: Ory is open source
sidebar_label: Overview
---

Ory has an open source architecture, attitude, and heart. We believe in collaboration, participation, and the open exchange of
ideas. We believe that open source is a fundamental part of modern software development. Open source allows everyone - regardless
of economic background - to build a better world with software.

Therefore, most of what we do is open source. Our deep commitment and history in open source software development **isn't a
marketing ploy**.
[We've spent thousands of work hours, committed hundred of thousands of changes, and published millions lines of code under permissive open source licenses such as MIT and Apache 2.0](https://github.com/ory).

Below you will find our most popular open source projects, their documentation, and more.
