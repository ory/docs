Ory has an open-source architecture, attitude, and heart. We believe in collaboration, participation, and the open exchange of
ideas. Open source is a fundamental part of modern software development and allows everyone regardless of economic background to
build a better world with software.

Therefore, most of what Ory does is open source. Read more about [Ory's commitment to open source](./open-source/commitment.mdx).
