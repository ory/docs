## Overview

Ory OAuth2 and OpenID Connect is by default configured to work with the Ory Identity Provider. And for most use cases no additional configuration is required.
This document will explain how to configure your Ory project to allow for more advanced use cases such as persisting OAuth2 logins through the Ory Identity Provider flows.

It is sometimes necessary to persist an OAuth2 login through a complex Ory Identity flow such as account recovery.
The benefit of persisting the OAuth2 login is so that the user does not get stuck on the Ory Identity provider settings page,
but instead is redirected back to the original application that initiated the login flow.

### Ory Console Configuration

In Ory Network we can achieve this by enabling the `Always Return to OAuth2 provider` setting in the Ory Console
under the **OAuth2** tab -> **Basic Settings** section.

:::info

Enabling this setting overrides the `return_to` query parameter and always redirects back to the OAuth2 provider within an OAuth2 login flow.

### CLI Configuration

```shell
ory patch ory patch project <your-project-id> \
  --replace '/services/identity/oauth2/override_return_to=true'
```
