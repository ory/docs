In OAuth2 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocols, access tokens and ID tokens have an expiration time. When the token expires, the
user needs to obtain a new token to continue accessing the protected resource. The process of obtaining a new token is called
token refresh.

In this document, we explain how to refresh OAuth2 and OIDC tokens with Ory. We cover the refresh token, the requirements for
obtaining a refresh token, the refresh token flow, refreshing access and ID tokens, refresh token rotation, and security
protections.

:::info

The JavaScript example code contained in this article is exemplary and explains what happens under the hood. You should use tried
and tested open source libraries to consume OAuth2 and OpenID Connect. You shouldn't write this code yourself, just as you
wouldn't write your own SHA512 library.

## The refresh token

The refresh token is a special token that can be used to obtain a new access token or ID token without the user's involvement. The
refresh token is issued to the client during the initial token issuance and can be used to obtain a new token when the current
token expires.

## Refresh token flow

Here's a sequence diagram that shows the refresh token flow:

```mdx-code-block
import Mermaid from "@site/src/theme/Mermaid";

<Mermaid
  chart={`sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Authorization Server
    Client->>Authorization Server: Refresh token request
    Authorization Server->>Client: New access token or ID token
`} />
```

In the refresh token flow, the client sends a request to the authorization server with the refresh token. The authorization server
checks if the refresh token is valid and if it is, issues a new access token or ID token to the client.

## Requirements for obtaining a refresh token

Only Authorization Code (`response_type=code`) and hybrid flows yield refresh tokens. They are always issued alongside an access
token during code exchange.

The client configuration must have the `offline_access` scope in its list of allowed scopes, and the `refresh_token` and
`authorization_code` grant types enabled.

To obtain a refresh token, the client must request the `offline_access` scope during the authorization request.

## Refreshing an access token

When a client refreshes an access token, the old access token becomes invalid, and only the new token is valid. The client can
continue accessing the protected resource with the new access token.

Here's an example of how to refresh an access token with Ory:

```js
// Set up the endpoint and refresh token
const endpoint = "https://oauth2.example.com/token"
const refreshToken = "<refresh token>"
const clientId = "<client id>"
const clientSecret = "<client secret>"

const params = new URLSearchParams({
  grant_type: "refresh_token",
  refresh_token: refreshToken,
  scope: "scope1 scope2",
  client_id: clientId,
  client_secret: clientSecret,
})
// Send a POST request to refresh the access token
fetch(endpoint, {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
  },
  body: params.toString(),
})
  .then((response) => {
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error("Failed to refresh access token")
    }
    return response.json()
  })
  .then((data) => {
    console.log("New access token:", data.access_token)
    console.log("New ID token:", data.id_token)
    console.log("New refresh token:", data.refresh_token)
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error)
  })
```

### Refreshing an ID token

When a client uses a refresh token to obtain a new access token, the authorization server may also issue a new ID token if the
original token exchange included an ID token.

The new ID token has an updated expiry time but retains the same `auth_time` (time when the user authenticated). The `auth_time`
claim in the ID token is used to determine if the user's authentication session is still active.

## Refresh token rotation and security protections

Refresh tokens are single-use only, meaning that they become invalid after the first use. Every time a client uses a refresh token
to request access tokens, a new refresh token is issued, and the previous token is invalidated. This mechanism adds another layer
of security and makes it more difficult for attackers to use stolen refresh tokens.

To use refresh tokens, the client needs to store the refresh token securely. Refresh tokens are long-lived, which means they can
be used for an extended period. Therefore, it's essential to store the token securely and protect it from unauthorized access. You
can consider the following storage layers:

- `httpOnly` and `secure` cookies (recommended)
- OS keychain when on mobile apps (recommended)
- `Window.localStorage` (acceptable)

## Change refresh token lifespan

You can adjust the Refresh Token lifespan (TTL) using the `/ttl/refresh_token` configuration key. By default, the TTL is set to 30
days.

:::note

The maximum age of refresh tokens is 6 months. This means that refresh tokens must be rotated at least every 6 months.

```bash
ory patch oauth2-config --project <project-id> --workspace <workspace-id> \
  --replace "/ttl/refresh_token=\"900h\"" \
  --format yaml
```

## Custom consent UI

When using a custom UI for the consent screen, it's essential to include the `offline_access` scope in the list of `grant_scope`
for a refresh token to be returned.

Here's an example of how to include the `offline_access` scope in the list of `grant_scope` when using a custom UI for the consent
screen:

```mdx-code-block
import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock'
import tsExample from '!!raw-loader!../../code-examples/sdk/typescript/src/oauth2/consent-accept-offline.ts'

<CodeBlock language="tsx">{tsExample}</CodeBlock>
```
