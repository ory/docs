OAuth 2.0 is an authorization framework that enables applications to access user accounts on an HTTP service. This guide provides
an overview of OAuth 2 roles, grant types, use cases, and flows, geared towards application developers. OAuth 2.0 provides access
to resources hosted by other web apps on behalf of a user, without sharing the user's credentials. The specification also covers
delegated access to client types such as browser-based, server-side web, native/mobile apps, and connected devices. This post aims
to simplify the terminology and decisions required for most OAuth 2 implementations.

## OAuth2 Actors

OAuth2 has different actors defined in the authentication and authorization process. These actors work together to ensure that the
user's information is kept secure and that the application only accesses the information that the user has explicitly granted
permission for.

### The User: "Resource Owner"

The Resource Owner is the person or system that owns the protected resources, such as an account, file, or data, and has the
ability to grant access to them. In the context of OAuth2 and OpenID Connect, the Resource Owner is typically a user who has an
account with a service or application.

When an application wants to access a Resource Owner's account, it must first request authorization from the Resource Owner. The
Resource Owner has the ability to limit the application's access to their account to a specific scope, such as read or write
access, as defined by the application. This means that the application can only access the user's account within the limits of the
authorization granted.

For example, if a user wants to use an application that requires access to their email account, the user must first grant the
application permission to access their account. The user can choose to grant access only to specific emails or folders, or limit
the application's access to read-only mode. The Resource Owner is in complete control of who can access their account and what
level of access they are granted.

With Ory OAuth2 and OpenID Connect, developers have the flexibility to use their own user management systems to store and manage
Resource Owners, while still taking advantage of the robust authorization and authentication mechanisms provided by these
protocols. Per default, Ory Identities is used to store and manage Resource Owners in Ory.

### The Application: "OAuth2 Client"

The OAuth2 client is the application that requires access to protected resources, such as a user's account or data. Before the
client can access these resources, it must first obtain an Access Token, which serves as proof of authorization to access the
requested resources. The client must first be authorized by the Resource Owner and must hold a valid Access Token in order to
access protected resources. The API server that hosts the protected resources will validate the Access Token to ensure that the
client is authorized to access the requested resources.

### The API: "Resource Server"

The Resource Server is a server that hosts and protects the user's resources, such as their account information or data. It is
typically an API server that exposes a set of endpoints that allow clients to access the protected resources. The Resource Server
receives access requests from the OAuth2 Client and verifies the Access Token presented with the request to ensure that the
request is authorized. If the Access Token is valid and authorized, the Resource Server returns the appropriate resources to the
client. If the Access Token is invalid or unauthorized, the Resource Server returns an error message to the client.

### The Authorization Server: Ory OAuth2 & OpenID Connect

The Authorization Server is a critical component in the OAuth2 flow. It receives requests from the Client for Access Tokens and
issues them upon successful authentication and consent by the Resource Owner. The authorization server exposes two endpoints: the
Authorization endpoint and the Token endpoint. The Authorization endpoint is responsible for handling the interactive
authentication and consent of the user, while the Token endpoint is involved in a machine-to-machine interaction.

The Authorization endpoint is where the Resource Owner approves or denies the request from the Client. This endpoint presents an
interface to the Resource Owner that allows them to view the scope of the requested access and make an informed decision about
whether to grant or deny access to their resources. In smaller implementations, the Authorization Server may be combined with the
API server, but larger scale deployments will often build this as a separate component.

## OAuth 2.0 scope represents user consent

OAuth2 scope is a parameter used to specify the level of access that OAuth2 Clients have to protected resources. It enables
Resource Owners to define specific permissions or actions that a client is authorized to perform in their name.

Scopes are an important concept in OAuth 2.0, as they are used to specify exactly why access to resources may be granted. For
example, a scope may include read access to a user's email, write access to a user's calendar, or access to a specific set of
files. The acceptable scope values, and which resources they relate to, are dependent on the Resource Server.

It is important to note that the difference between scope and permission is that scopes define what the client is authorized to
access in the name of the user, whereas permissions (think RBAC, ACL) define what the user themselves are allowed to do. By using
scope, users can control the level of access that clients have to protected resources. But the user has access to "their"
resources only, not the resources (e.g. photos) of another user.

Ory OAuth2 & OpenID Connect has pre-defined OAuth 2.0 Scope values:

- `offline_access`: Include this scope if you wish to receive a refresh token
- `openid`: Include this scope if you wish to perform an OpenID Connect request.

## OAuth 2.0 access token audience

The Audience of an Access Token refers to the Resource Servers that this token is intended for. The audience usually refers to one
or more URLs such as

- `https://api.mydomain.com/blog/posts`
- `https://api.mydomain.com/users`

but may also refer to a subset of resources:

- `https://api.mydomain.com/tenants/foo/users`

When performing an OAuth 2.0 Flow where the end-user is involved (for example Implicit or Authorize Code), the granted audience
must be set when accepting the consent using the `grant_access_token_audience` key. In most cases, it's ok to grant the audience
without user-interaction.

## Creating an OAuth2 Client

Creating an OAuth2 Client is a necessary step to enable your application to use the OAuth2 flow. Before using OAuth with your
application, you must first register your application with the service you plan to integrate with. This is done through a
registration form in the developer or API portion of the service’s website, where you will provide the following information about
your application: Application Name, Application Website, and a Redirect URI or Callback URL.

The Application Name and Website are basic pieces of information that identify your application. The Redirect URI or Callback URL
is a crucial part of the registration process as it is where the service will redirect the user after they authorize (or deny)
your application. The Redirect URI is also where your application will handle authorization codes or access tokens, making it an
important component of the OAuth2 flow.

It is important to ensure that the Redirect URI or Callback URL is correctly specified during the registration process, as it is a
critical part of the OAuth2 flow. Without a correctly specified Redirect URI, the OAuth2 flow will not be able to complete
successfully, resulting in an error for the user. Overall, registering your application with the service and specifying the
correct Redirect URI or Callback URL is a necessary step to enable your application to use the OAuth2 flow and access protected
resources.

#### Client ID and secret

Once you have registered your application with the service, you will typically receive a Client ID and optionally a Client Secret
from the Authorization Server. These are unique identifiers that allow the Authorization Server to identify your application and
enable it to access protected resources. The Client ID is considered public information and can be included in JavaScript source
code or used to build login URLs. The Client Secret, however, must be kept confidential and is used to authenticate the client to
the Authorization Server.

The `token_endpoint_auth_method` parameter is an optional parameter that is used to specify the client authentication method when
requesting an Access Token. This parameter is included in the request to the Token endpoint and can be set to a variety of values,
including `client_secret_basic` (default), `client_secret_post`, and `none`. The value of this parameter can affect how the client
authenticates itself to the Authorization Server.

For example, if the value of the `token_endpoint_auth_method` parameter is set to `client_secret_basic`, the client will
authenticate itself to the Authorization Server by including the Client ID and Client Secret in the Authorization header of the
request:

```
POST /oauth2/token
Host: server.example.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Authorization: Basic base64(urlencoded(id):urlencoded(secret))
```

If the value of the `token_endpoint_auth_method` parameter is set to `client_secret_post`, the client will authenticate itself to
the Authorization Server by including the Client ID and Client Secret in the form body of the request:

```
POST /oauth2/token
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

client_id=id&client_secret=secret
```

The `none` method is typically used for public clients, such as Single Page Applications (SPAs) and mobile apps, which are not
capable of keeping a client secret confidential. When the token_endpoint_auth_method parameter is set to "none", the client does
not include any credentials when requesting an Access Token. This means that the client relies solely on the redirect URI to
securely receive the Access Token, rather than using a shared secret to authenticate itself to the Authorization Server.

## Getting a client token

OAuth2 defines several grant types, each of which is intended for a specific type of client application.

### Client credentials flow

The client credentials flow is designed for non-interactive applications, such as automated processes or microservices, where the
client is authenticated using its client ID and client secret. In this flow, the application sends a POST request to the
Authorization Server, including its credentials and a request for an access token. If the credentials are verified, the
Authorization Server returns an access token to the application, which can then use it to access its own account.

Fore more information, see the [Client Credentials Flow](../client-credentials.mdx).

### Authorization code flow

The authorization code flow, on the other hand, is the most commonly used flow and is optimized for server-side applications where
client secret confidentiality can be maintained. In this flow, the user is first presented with an authorization code link that
includes the application's client ID and other parameters, such as the redirect URI and the requested scope of access. After the
user approves the application, the service redirects the user-agent to the redirect URI specified by the application, including an
authorization code. The application then exchanges this code, along with its client secret, for an access token using the token
endpoint.

It's worth noting that in this flow, the client secret cannot be stored securely, since it needs to be included in the request to
the token endpoint. For this reason, single-page applications and mobile/native apps are often not appropriate for this flow, and
should instead use the authorization code with PKCE grant. In addition, the scope parameter is used to specify the level of access
that the application is requesting, and acceptable scope values are dependent on the Resource Server. Overall, the authorization
code flow is a redirection-based flow that relies on the user-agent (i.e. the user’s web browser) and API authorization codes to
securely handle authentication and consent.

Fore more information, see the [OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code flow](../authorization-code-flow.mdx).

## Use case examples

### Server-side web apps

Server-side web applications, such as those built with Node.js or PHP, are typically best suited to using the
[OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code flow](../authorization-code-flow.mdx). This is because server-side applications are able to keep the
client secret confidential, which is necessary for using the authorization code flow.

In addition, it is recommended that server-side web applications use the authorization code flow with PKCE to provide an added
layer of security. The PKCE extension helps to mitigate the risk of attacks by requiring the client to generate a code verifier
for every authorization request, which is then transformed into a code challenge and sent to the authorization endpoint along with
the request.

### Mobile apps

When it comes to mobile applications, the [OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code flow](../authorization-code-flow.mdx) is the recommended
flow to use with OAuth2. Because mobile applications are considered "public clients," it is highly recommended to use the
Authorization Code flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) extension.

### Single page apps

Single page applications (SPAs) are web applications that run inside a web browser and dynamically update the page as the user
interacts with the application. Because the client-side code of an SPA is fully exposed to the user, it's not safe to store a
client secret in the application. As a result, SPAs should also use the
[OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code flow](../authorization-code-flow.mdx) flow with PKCE, to ensure the client secret is not exposed.

For example, an SPA that uses OAuth 2.0 to access Google APIs would use the Authorization Code flow with PKCE. When the user
clicks the "Sign in with Google" button, the SPA would redirect the user to Google's authorization endpoint, where they would be
prompted to grant permission for the application to access their Google account. If the user grants permission, Google will return
an authorization code to the SPA, which can then exchange it for an access token using the token endpoint. The SPA can then use
the access token to access the user's data on Google's APIs. By using PKCE, the SPA can ensure that the authorization code cannot
be intercepted and used by an attacker.

### Smart devices

The device code flow is designed for devices that have limited inputs or do not have a web browser, and need to obtain an access
token to access a user’s account. This grant type provides an easier way for users to authorize applications on such devices to
access their accounts. It is particularly useful in scenarios where users want to sign in to an application on a device that lacks
a typical keyboard input, such as a smart TV or video game console.

With the device code grant type, the user initiates the flow on a separate device, such as a phone or computer, and is presented
with a device code. The user then enters this code on the device that needs to obtain the access token. This device will
periodically poll the authorization server until the user grants or denies the authorization request. Once the user grants access,
the device receives an access token that can be used to access the user's account.

## Accessing APIs

Sending an access token to a resource server usually involves including the token in the HTTP `Authorization` header of the
request. Here's an example code snippet in JavaScript that shows how to do this:

```js
const fetch = require("node-fetch")
const accessToken = "your_access_token_here"

fetch("https://api.example.com/resource", {
  headers: {
    Authorization: "Bearer " + accessToken,
  },
})
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((data) => console.log(data))
  .catch((error) => console.error(error))
```

In this example, the access token is included in the `Authorization` header of the GET request to the resource server API
endpoint. The `Bearer` keyword indicates that the token is a bearer token, which is a type of access token that can be used by any
client to access the protected resources. The resource server will then verify the token and grant or deny access based on the
token's validity and the scope of access that was granted.

The resource server needs to ensure that the access token is valid and has not been tampered with or expired before allowing
access to protected resources. To achieve this, the resource server uses the OAuth2 token
[introspection endpoint](../../hydra/guides/oauth2-token-introspection.mdx), which is an API endpoint exposed by Ory.

## Resource Owner Password Credentials flow

Ory doesn't support the Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant Type as we prepare for [OAuth 2.1](https://oauth.net/2.1/) which
removed this grant type.

## Implicit flow

As the industry has evolved, so has the best practice for implementing OAuth2 in mobile and native apps. Previously, the Implicit
grant was recommended, but it has since been found to be less secure. The current recommendation is to use the authorization code
flow with PKCE for native apps, which provides greater security for both the user and the application.
