Ory OAuth2 & OpenID Connect is a powerful tool implementing OpenID Connect RP-Initiated Logout 1.0, OpenID Connect Front-Channel
Logout 1.0, and OpenID Connect Back-Channel Logout 1.0 flows. In this guide, we will show you how to perform OpenID Connect front-
and back-channel logout using Ory OAuth2 & OpenID Connect.

## OpenID Connect Front-Channel Logout 1.0

OpenID Connect Front-Channel Logout 1.0 is a feature that allows an OAuth2 client to register fields `frontchannel_logout_uri`. If
`frontchannel_logout_uri` is set to a valid URL, Ory will redirect the user-agent (typically browser) to that URL after a logout
occurred. This allows the OAuth2 client application to log out the end-user in its own system as well, for example by deleting a
cookie or otherwise invalidating the user session.

Ory OAuth2 & OpenID Connect always appends query parameters values `iss` and `sid` to the Front-Channel Logout URI. Each OpenID
Connect ID Token is issued with a `sid` claim that will match the `sid` value from the Front-Channel Logout URI. Ory OAuth2 &
OpenID Connect will automatically execute the required HTTP Redirects to make this work. No extra work is required.

To use OpenID Connect Front-Channel Logout 1.0 with Ory OAuth2 & OpenID Connect, follow these steps:

1. Register a field `frontchannel_logout_uri` with a valid URL in your OAuth2 client application.
2. When a logout occurs, Ory will redirect the user-agent (browser) to the specified URL.
3. The OAuth2 client application can then log out the end-user in its own system as well, for example by deleting a cookie or
   otherwise invalidating the user session.

## OpenID Connect Back-Channel Logout 1.0

OpenID Connect Back-Channel Logout 1.0 is a feature that allows an OAuth2 client to register fields `backchannel_logout_uri` and
`backchannel_logout_session_required`. If `backchannel_logout_uri` is set to a valid URL, a HTTP Post request with
`Content-Type application/x-www-form-urlencoded` and a `logout_token` will be made to that URL when a end-user logs out. The
`logout_token` is a JWT signed with the same key that's used to sign OpenID Connect ID Tokens. You should thus validate the
`logout_token` using the ID Token Public Key (can be fetched from `/.well-known/jwks.json`). The `logout_token` contains the
following claims:

- `iss`: Issuer Identifier for the Issuer of the response. The iss value is a case-sensitive URL using the https scheme that
  contains scheme, host, and optionally, port number and path components and no query or fragment components.
- `aud`: Audience(s) that this ID Token is intended for. It contains the OAuth 2.0 client_id of the as an audience value.
- `iat`: Time at which the JWT was issued. Can be used to determine the age of the JWT.
- `jti`: A unique identifier for the JWT. Can be used to prevent the JWT from being replayed. This is helpful for a one time use
  token.
- `events`: Claim whose value is a JSON object containing the member name http://schemas.openid.net/event/backchannel-logout. This
  declares that the JWT is a Logout Token. The corresponding member value MUST be a JSON object and SHOULD be the empty JSON
  object `{}`.
- `sid`: Session ID - A session ID that is used to associate a particular session with an ID Token. The value is passed as a
  parameter to the logout endpoint when logging out of the OP.

```json title="Logout token example claims"
{
  "iss": "https://server.example.com",
  "aud": "s6BhdRkqt3",
  "iat": 1471566154,
  "jti": "bWJq",
  "sid": "08a5019c-17e1-4977-8f42-65a12843ea02",
  "events": {
    "http://schemas.openid.net/event/backchannel-logout": {}
  }
}
```

After the `logout_token` is validated, the endpoint returns a HTTP 200 OK response with cache-control headers set to

```
Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store
Pragma: no-cache
```

Since the back-channel logout flow is not executed using the user-agent (such as a browser), the session cookie of the end-user is
not available to the OAuth 2.0 Client, and the session has to be invalidated by some other means.

## Send the ID Token in `id_token_hint`

`id_token_hint` is an optional query parameter that can be provided in the logout request to indicate which OpenID Connect ID
Token was used to authenticate the user. This parameter is useful for identifying the user's session and ensuring that the user is
properly logged out.

When the `id_token_hint` is not provided, the logout request may still succeed, but it could lead to issues in cases where the
OAuth 2.0 Client has multiple sessions for the same user, the session cookie is no longer available, or the login request was not
remembered. In such cases, without the `id_token_hint`, the OAuth 2.0 Client may not know which session to log out.

It is, therefore, recommended to always send the `id_token_hint` parameter in the logout request to avoid such issues if possible.

## Redirect after logout

The `post_logout_redirect_uri` parameter in the OpenID Connect front and back-channel logout flow is used to redirect the user's
browser to a specified URL after the logout process is complete.

To make the `post_logout_redirect_uri` parameter work, the OAuth 2.0 Client should follow these steps:

1. Allow the `post_logout_redirect_uri`: Each OAuth 2.0 Client can whitelist a list of URIs that can be used as the
   `post_logout_redirect_uri` parameter value using the `post_logout_redirect_uris` field. This field should be set to a list of
   valid URIs that the OAuth 2.0 Client allows as the `post_logout_redirect_uri`.
2. Set the `post_logout_redirect_uri` parameter value in the logout request: When making the logout request to Ory OAuth2 & OpenID
   Connect, the OAuth 2.0 Client should include the `post_logout_redirect_uri` parameter value in the URL query. The value should
   be set to the desired redirect URL.
3. Set the `state` parameter value in the logout request: When making the logout request, the OAuth 2.0 Client should include a
   `state` parameter value in the URL query. This value should be a random string used to maintain state between the logout
   request and the response. After the logout process is complete, the state value will be returned in the URL query of the
   redirect back to the OAuth 2.0 Client's application.
4. Set the `id_token_hint` parameter value in the logout request: When making the logout request, the OAuth 2.0 Client should
   include an `id_token_hint` parameter value in the URL query. This value should be set to the ID Token that was issued by Ory
   OAuth2 & OpenID Connect to the user during the authentication process. If included, this parameter value can help to ensure
   that the logout process can be performed even if no session cookie exists any more.
