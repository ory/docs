In first-party scenarios, you may want to skip the consent screen and automatically grant consent to the client. This can be done
by setting the `require_consent` property to `false` on the client configuration.

```shell
ory create oauth2-client \
  --skip-consent \
  # ...
```

## Skip logout consent

The logout consent screen requires the user to confirm that they indeed wish to log out. This is useful for preventing third-party
applications from logging out the user without their consent. However, in some cases, you may want to skip this screen. This can
be done by setting the `require_logout_consent` property to `false` on the client configuration:

```shell
ory create oauth2-client \
  --skip-logout-consent \
  # ...
```
