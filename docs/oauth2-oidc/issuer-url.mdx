To change the OAuth2 and OpenID Connect Issuer URL, run the following [Ory CLI](../guides/cli/installation.mdx) command:

```shell
ory patch oauth2-config {project-id} \
  --replace '/urls/self/issuer="https://auth.myexample.org"'
```

Ideally, this URL is the CNAME domain you have set up for the Ory Network.
