In some cases, the issuer URL of the OAuth2 and OpenID Connect server needs to be changed. This can be the case if you are
updating your primary custom domain or when you have a project created before February 13th 2024.

To see what your current issuer URL is use the [Ory CLI](../guides/cli/01_installation.mdx):

```shell
ory get oauth2-config {project-id} --format json | jq '.urls.self.issuer'
```

To change the OAuth2 and OpenID Connect Issuer URL, run the following [Ory CLI](../guides/cli/01_installation.mdx) command:

```shell
ory patch oauth2-config {project-id} \
  --replace '/urls/self/issuer="https://auth.myexample.org"'
```

Ideally, this URL is the CNAME domain you have set up for the Ory Network.
