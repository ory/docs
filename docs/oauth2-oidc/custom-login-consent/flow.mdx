This guide will walk you through the process of customizing Ory OAuth2 and OpenID Connect to work with your user database, login
UI, and consent logic and UI. We'll cover everything you need to know, including how to redirect users to your login endpoint, how
to fetch and process login and consent requests, and how to use the SDK to accept or reject these requests.

:::note

By default, Ory OAuth2 and OpenID Connect is integrated with Ory Identities and the Ory Account Experience. Read this document if
you want to customize the user backend, login UI, or consent logic and UI.

## How Ory OAuth2 and OpenID Connect works

OAuth2 and OpenID Connect requires an authenticated end user session for all OAuth2 / OpenID Connect flows except the client
Credentials flow which doesn't involve end users. Ory OAuth2 and OpenID Connect doesn't contain a database with end users but
instead uses HTTP redirection to "delegate" the login flow to another app - this is the "Ory OAuth 2.0 login & consent flow".

## Example implementation

You can find an example
[Node.js implementation of an app that implements custom login and consent on Ory's GitHub](https://github.com/ory/hydra-login-consent-node).

## Login

The OAuth2 2.0 / OpenID Connect Flow is initiated by pointing the end user's browser to the `/oauth2/auth` endpoint. Depending on
the OAuth2 flow you want to use, some of the query parameters (for example `/oauth2/auth?response_type=code` or
`/oauth2/auth?response_type=token`) can change. Starting flows always involves sending the browser to that URL.

The next task for Ory OAuth2 and OpenID Connect is to know the user of the request. To achieve that, Ory OAuth2 and OpenID Connect
checks if a session cookie is set containing information about a previously successful login. Additionally, OpenID Connect
parameters `id_token_hint`, `prompt`, and `max_age` are evaluated and processed. Depending on their values and the login state,
the user might need to re-authenticate or the flow will fail.

To authenticate the user (this happens regardless of whether a session exists for the user or not), Ory OAuth2 and OpenID Connect
redirects the browser to the "login endpoint" established in your config:

```shell
ory patch oauth2-config
  --replace "/urls/login=\"https://login.example.org/oauth2-login\""
```

Ory OAuth2 and OpenID Connect appends a `login_challenge` query parameter to the URL. The value is an ID which should later be
used by the login endpoint to fetch important information about the request.

```
https://login.example.org/oauth2-login?login_challenge=7bb518c4
```

The way you authenticate the end user is up to you. In most cases, you will show an HTML form similar to:

```html title="Example login form"
<form action="/login" method="post">
  <input type="hidden" name="csrf_token" value="...." />
  <!-- Use CSRF tokens in your HTML forms! -->
  <input type="email" name="login_email" placeholder="Please enter your email address to log in" />
  <input type="password" name="login_password" />
  <input type="checkbox" name="remember" value="Remember me on this device" />
  <input type="submit" value="Log in" />
</form>
```

### Login endpoint code example

The Login Endpoint (set by configuration key `/urls/login`) is an application written by you. It uses the `login_challenge` value
in the URL to complete the login flow using the Ory SDK:

```mdx-code-block
import loginVerbose from '!!raw-loader!../../../code-examples/sdk/typescript/src/oauth2/login-verbose.ts'
import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock'

<CodeBlock language="js">{loginVerbose}</CodeBlock>
```

The response contains information about the login request. The body contains a skip value. If the value is false, the user
interface must be shown. If skip is true, you shouldn't show the user interface but instead just accept or reject the login
request.

Once the end user authenticated successfully, you either accept the login challenge, or you reject (for example the user isn't
allowed to perform OAuth2 flows) the login challenge.

## Consent

Once the login challenge is accepted, Ory OAuth2 and OpenID Connect will ask the user for consent:

![OAuth 2.0 Asking for User Consent](../_static/oauth2-consent-screen.png)

The logic and UI is fully under your control, because Ory OAuth2 and OpenID Connect redirects the end user's browser to the
"Consent Endpoint" established in your config:

```shell
ory patch oauth2-config
  --replace "/urls/consent=\"https://consent.example.org/oauth2-consent\""
```

Ory OAuth2 and OpenID Connect appends a consent_challenge query parameter to the URL. The value is an ID which should later be
used by the Consent Endpoint to fetch important information about the request.

```text
https://consent.example.org/oauth2-consent?consent_challenge=7bb518c4eec2454dbb289f5fdb4c0ee2
```

The way you collect the consent information from the end user is up to you. In most cases, you will show an HTML form similar to:

```html
<form action="/consent" method="post">
  <input type="hidden" name="csrf_token" value="...." />
  <!-- Use CSRF tokens in your HTML forms! -->
  <input type="checkbox" name="scope" value="email" />
  <input type="checkbox" name="scope" value="profile" />
  <input type="submit" name="submit" value="accept" />
  <input type="submit" name="submit" value="reject" />
</form>
```

### Skipping consent for trusted clients

When you create an OAuth2 client in your Ory Network project, you can configure it to skip the "consent screen", which is the
screen where the user must explicitly agree to giving the client access to access their data and perform operations on their
behalf.

This approach is useful when you're working with trusted, first-party clients that don't require access to sensitive data. When
the client must access sensitive data or functionality, don't skip the consent screen and ensure that the user is well informed
before they allow the client to act on their behalf.

You can turn on skipping the consent screen on a per-client basis through the Ory Console. Follow these steps to enable consent
screen skipping for existing OAuth2 clients:

1. Sign in to the Ory Console and go to [**OAuth2** → **Clients**](https://console.ory.sh/projects/current/oauth).
2. Find the client for which you want to turn on consent skipping and click the [**pencil icon**] in the **Actions** column.
3. Use the **Skip consent** toggle in the **Consent screen** section to manage the feature. When you turn this feature on, consent
   skipping is enabled for the client.
4. Scroll back to the top and click **Save**.

You can enable consent skipping when you create new OAuth2 clients. Use the **Skip consent** toggle in the **Consent screen**
section to manage the feature.

#### Implementation

Skipping the consent screen is managed by the `challenge` object returned from
[getOAuth2ConsentRequest](https://www.ory.sh/docs/hydra/reference/api#tag/oAuth2/operation/getOAuth2ConsentRequest).

If the consent is skipped for the given OAuth2 client, `challenge.client.skip_consent` is `true`.

For TypeScript, the following snippet shows how to determine whether to skip the consent screen UI:

```ts
const { consent_challenge } = req.query // the HTTP request

const challenge = await oauth2
  .getOAuth2ConsentRequest({ consentChallenge: String(consent_challenge) })
  .then(({ data: body }) => body)

const skipConsent =
  challenge.skip || // skip because the user accepted the consent previously
  challenge.client.skip_consent // skip because the client is trusted

if (skipConsent) {
  // If the consent is skipped, we accept the consent request immediately.
  await oauth2.acceptOAuth2ConsentRequest({
    consentChallenge: String(consent_challenge),
    acceptOAuth2ConsentRequest: {
      grant_scope: challenge.requested_scope,
      grant_access_token_audience: challenge.requested_access_token_audience,
      session,
    },
  })
}

// Next, add code that shows the consent screen.
// This is used when the client doesn't have consent skipping enabled.
// Check out an example consent screen implementation in an app here:
// https://github.com/ory/hydra-login-consent-node/blob/master/src/routes/consent.ts#L41
```

### Previous consent

A consent has five distinctive attributes:

1. The requested scope (`scope=email+profile+offline_access`);
2. The OAuth2 client (`client_id=abcd`);
3. The end user (this is the subject set in the Login Flow);
4. If a previous consent exists, the previous consent has `remember: true`, and the scope granted by the user (did the user accept
   all of `email`, `profile`, `offline_access`).
5. Whether or not the OAuth2 client is set to always skip consent.

There are three possible states:

1. The user has never before authorized ("consent") the OAuth2 client before.
2. The user has authorized ("consent") the OAuth2 client before and chose to remember the "consent".
3. The user has authorized ("consent") the OAuth2 client before, and chose to remember the "consent", but the OAuth2 client now
   also wants additional permissions ("has changed the token scope" in /oauth2/auth?scope=...).

Regardless of which of these three states we're in, the end user's browser is always redirected to the Consent Endpoint. What
changes is the skip value, as explained a bit later.

In certain scenarios (for example a special OAuth2 client), you might not want to show the consent screen at all. In those cases,
you can choose to skip showing the UI and just accept the consent. Please keep in mind that OAuth2 is a delegation protocol and
that it makes most sense for third-party access. Not showing the consent screen will break OpenID Connect Certification.

### Consent endpoint code example

The Consent Endpoint uses the `consent_challenge` value in the URL to complete the consent using the Ory SDK:

```mdx-code-block
import consentVerbose from '!!raw-loader!../../../code-examples/sdk/typescript/src/oauth2/consent-verbose.ts'

<CodeBlock language="js">{consentVerbose}</CodeBlock>
```

The response contains information about the consent request. The body contains a `skip` value. If the value is `false`, the user
interface must be shown. If skip is `true`, you shouldn't show the user interface but instead just accept or reject the consent
request.
