The OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Grant (RFC 8628) brings OAuth to devices with internet connectivity but limited input 
capabilities. This flow is designed for smart TVs, streaming devices, IoT hardware, printers, remote terminal sessions, AI agents, and other connected devices 
where typing credentials or opening a browser isn't practical or possible. Here's how it works: the device to be authenticated displays a URL and a short code, prompting 
you to open that URL on your phone or computer to authorize access. After successful authorization, the device will get an access and (optionally) a refresh token. The two devices don't need to communicate directly—the authorization 
happens through the OAuth provider.

This document provides an overview of the Ory's device authorization grant flow, with a step-by-step example of its implementation, configuration
options, and guidance on creating custom user interfaces for the verification screen.

## Overview of the flow

Here is the high-level overview for the device authorization grant flow:

1. The user attempts to log in to the device. This initiates the device to request authorization from the authorization server.
1. When the authorization server responds, the user is instructed to visit a URL and enter the provided user code, which they do 
   on a different device.
1. On the different device the user visits the URL, enters the user code, (logs in, if needed) and grants access to the device.
1. In the meantime, the device polls the authorization server. Once the user authenticates and grants access, the authenicaton server 
   sends an access token to the device, which is used to access the protected resource.

    end

```

### Step 1: Device requests authorization

The user attempts to log in through the limited input device. The device sends a POST request to the authorization server to initiate
the flow with the following parameters:

- `client_id`: The ID of the client (device) that's making the request
- `scope` (optional): The scope of the access request, which specifies which resources the requesting device can access

The authorization server responds with the following information:

- `device_code`: A unique code to identify the authorization request
- `user_code`: A code the user enters at the verification URL
- `verification_uri`: The URL where the user authorizes the device
- `verification_uri_complete`: The URL where the user authorizes the device, with the user_code already filled in
- `expires_in`: The lifespan of the device code (in seconds)
- `interval`: The polling interval (in seconds) for the client to check if the user has authorized the device yet

### Step 2: Display user code and verification URI

The device shows the user the `user_code` and `verification_uri` it received from the authorization server. Depending on the device, this can be in the form of a URL, QR-code, acoustically, or any other form that the device can communicate with the user.

### Step 3: User grants permission

The user visits the provided URI on a separate device, such as a phone, and enters the code. Once the user enters the code, 
the user is prompted to log in, if not already authenticated, and grants or denies permission to the client (device). After granting 
permission, the user is redirected to a page confirming they are successfully logged in.

### Step 4: Device polls for the access token

While the user is authorizing the device, the device polls the `token` endpoint of the authorization server to check whether the
user has completed the authorization process, by making a POST request with the following parameters:

- `client_id`: The ID of the client that's making the request
- `device_code`: The device code returned from the authorization request
- `grant_type`: This must always be `urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:device_code`

After the user grants their consent, the authentication server sends an access token to the device, which is used to access the protected resource.

## Configuration options

### Configuring the user interface

To enable and configure the device authorization grant in Ory Hydra, adjust the following settings in your configuration file:

```yaml
urls:
  device:
    # The verification UI is where the user inputs the user-code
    verification: http://path/to/device/verification/ui
    # The success UI is where the user is sent to after successful authorization
    success: http://path/to/device/success
```

### Configuring user code entropy

Depending on your security needs and your traffic load, you should choose the appropriate `user_code` entropy. The 
`oauth2.device_authorization.user_code_entropy` configuration supports 3 values:

- `high`: `user_code` is 8 characters long and consists of alphanumeric characters, excluding some ambiguous symbols
- `medium`: `user_code` is 8 characters long and consists of only upper case alphabetic characters
- `low`: `user_code` is 9 characters long and consists of only numberic characters

As users will need to manually enter the user code, the higher the entropy, the more difficult it will be for the user to enter the user code.

## Device verification UI implementation

Here is a sample UI implementation for device verification:

```js
import { Configuration, OAuth2Api } from "@ory/client"
import { Request, Response } from "express"

const ory = new OAuth2Api(
  new Configuration({
    basePath: `https://${process.env.ORY_PROJECT_SLUG}.projects.oryapis.com`,
    accessToken: process.env.ORY_API_KEY,
  }),
)

// Please note that this is an example implementation.
// In a production app, please add proper error handling.
export async function handleLogin(request: Request, response: Response) {
  const challenge = request.query.device_challenge.toString()
  const userCode = request.query.user_code.toString()

  // Show the login form if the form was not submitted.
  if (request.method === "GET") {
    response.render("device", {
      challenge,
      userCode,
    })
    return
  }

  // User was authenticated successfully,
  return await ory
    .acceptUserCodeRequest({
      deviceChallenge: challenge,
      acceptDeviceUserCodeRequest: {
        user_code: userCode,
      },
    })
    .then(({ redirect_to }) => {
      response.redirect(String(redirect_to))
    })
}
```
