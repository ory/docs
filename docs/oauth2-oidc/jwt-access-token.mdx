JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are a widely used format for representing claims securely between parties. They can be used as access
tokens, which are used to grant access to protected resources, such as APIs. JWTs consist of three parts:

- **Header:** contains metadata about the token, such as the algorithm used to sign it.
- **Payload:** contains claims, which are statements about an entity (typically, the user) and additional data.
- **Signature:** used to verify that the token was not tampered with.

## Opaque access tokens versus JWT

By default, Ory issues opaque access tokens, which are random strings with a cryptographic signature that have no meaning or
structure. Opaque tokens are stored in a database, and their validity is checked by performing a database lookup.

Here's an example of an opaque token:

```
ory_at_JGhESDjKfHMQ8Wcy0cC3.hIQxGmX37ydn8WmKAnlD3U
```

Opaque tokens are stored in a database, and their validity can be checked by performing a database lookup. This means that if you
need to revoke an opaque token, you can simply delete it from the database. Once the token has been deleted, any subsequent
attempts to use it will fail.

JWTs, on the other hand, are self-contained and do not require a database lookup to validate. Instead, JWTs contain a signature
that can be verified to ensure that the token has not been tampered with. Because of this, revoking a JWT requires a different
approach.

Overall, opaque tokens have an advantage when it comes to revocation, as they can be immediately revoked by deleting them from the
database. JWTs, on the other hand, have a delay between being marked as invalid and actually becoming invalid, which can be a
problem in some cases. However, it's worth noting that opaque tokens require a network roundtrip to the introspection API to
validate, which can be slower than validating a JWT.

|            | opaque tokens | jwt tokens |
| ---------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| revocation | immediate     | eventually |
| latency    | ~50ms         | ~1ms       |

## Refresh tokens are always opaque

Ory uses opaque tokens for refresh tokens. Refresh tokens are used in OAuth 2.0 to obtain new access tokens once the original
access token has expired. Refresh tokens are always opaque tokens in Ory because they must be immediately revocable if needed.

## JWT access tokens

### Global configuration

To configure Ory OAuth2 to issue JWT access tokens for all clients, you must update the configuration as Ory defaults to opaque
tokens:

```shell
ory patch oauth2-config --project <project-id> --workspace <workspace-id> \
  --replace "/strategies/access_token=\"jwt\""
```

### Per-client configuration

To configure Ory OAuth2 to issue JWT access tokens for a specific client, you'll need to update the client configuration as Ory
defaults to opaque tokens:

```mdx-code-block
import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock'
import setAccessTokenStrategyExample from '!!raw-loader!../../code-examples/sdk/typescript/src/oauth2/client-set-access-token-strategy.ts'

<CodeBlock language="tsx">{setAccessTokenStrategyExample}</CodeBlock>
```

The setting is also available through the Ory Console under the clients' settings.

### Revoking JSON Web Tokens

One limitation of using JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) as access tokens is that they can't be revoked immediately after being issued.
Instead, revoking a JWT requires either waiting for it to expire or using a blacklist or revocation list to mark the token as
invalid.

However, there is another option for checking whether a JWT has been revoked: OAuth 2.0 token introspection. Token introspection
is a feature of OAuth 2.0 that allows a client to query the authorization server to determine the validity and other metadata of
an access token.

To use token introspection to check whether a JWT has been revoked, the client sends a request to the authorization server's
introspection endpoint, providing the access token in question as a parameter. The introspection endpoint responds with
information about the token, including its validity, expiry time, and any associated metadata.

Here's an example of a token introspection request using the SDK:

```mdx-code-block
import tsExample from '!!raw-loader!../../code-examples/sdk/typescript/src/oauth2/token-introspect.ts'

<CodeBlock language="tsx">{tsExample}</CodeBlock>
```

### Limitations

While JWTs have many benefits as access tokens, there are also some limitations to consider:

- OAuth 2.0 Access Tokens represent internal state but are public knowledge: An Access Token often contains internal data (such as
  session data) or other sensitive data (such as user roles and permissions) and is sometimes used as a means of transporting
  system-relevant information in a stateless manner. Therefore, making these tokens transparent (by using JSON Web Tokens as
  Access Tokens) comes with the risk of exposing this information, and with the downside of not storing this information in the
  OAuth 2.0 Access Token at all.
- JSON Web Tokens can't hold secrets: Unless encrypted, JSON Web Tokens can be read by everyone, including third parties.
- Access Tokens as JSON Web Tokens can't be revoked: You can revoke a JWT token, but the token is still considered valid until the
  token's expiry time is reached. If required, however, you can use the introspection API to check if the token was revoked.
- Certain OpenID Connect features don't work: When using JSON Web Tokens as access tokens, certain OpenID Connect features might
  not work, such as the pairwise subject identifier algorithm.

### JSON Web Token validation

You can validate JSON Web Tokens issued by Ory by pointing your `jwt` library (for example
[node-jwks-rsa](https://github.com/auth0/node-jwks-rsa)) to:

```
http://$PROJECT_SLUG.projects.oryapis.com/.well-known/jwks.json
```

All necessary keys are available there.

#### Default JSON Web Key Sets

In Ory, JSON Web Key (JWK) endpoints require a `set-id`. This `set-id` corresponds to the specific set of keys you want to
interact with. If you're looking to interact with the default keys used by Ory, you can use the following `set-id` values:

- `hydra.openid.id-token`: This set contains the keys used for signing OpenID Connect ID Tokens.
- `hydra.jwt.access-token`: This set contains the keys used for signing JWT Access Tokens.

You can use these `set-id` values with the JWK endpoints to retrieve, rotate, or otherwise manage these default key sets. For
example, to retrieve the OpenID Connect ID Token key set, you would use the `GET /admin/keys/{set}` endpoint with
`hydra.openid.id-token` as the `{set}` parameter. This information is particularly useful when rotating keys, as described in the
[documentation on key rotation](../hydra/self-hosted/secrets-key-rotation). Remember, these are the default key sets used by Ory.
If you've configured Ory to use different key sets, you'll need to use the `set-id` values corresponding to your custom key sets.

## Custom consent UI and custom claims for (JWT) access token

Using the following code during, you can add custom claims to every access token during consent acceptance

```mdx-code-block
import customClaimTsExample from '!!raw-loader!../../code-examples/sdk/typescript/src/oauth2/consent-custom-claim.ts'

<CodeBlock language="tsx">{customClaimTsExample}</CodeBlock>
```

Which results in the following access token:

```json5
{
  sub: "...",
  // ...
  ext: {
    some_custom_claim: "some_custom_value",
  },
  // ...
}
```

### Add custom claims to top level

If you want `some_custom_claim` to be added to the top level (instead of a nested level) in the access token, you need to modify
the `/oauth2/allowed_top_level_claims` configuration:

:::note

Required JWT claims can't be overwritten by custom claims.

:::

```shell
ory patch oauth2-config --project <project-id> --workspace <workspace-id> \
  --replace "/oauth2/allowed_top_level_claims=[\"some_custom_claim\"]"
```

Which results in an access token with the following structure:

```json
{
  "sub": "...",
  // ...
  "some_custom_claim": "some_custom_value",
  "ext": {
    "some_custom_claim": "some_custom_value"
  }
  // ...
}
```

### Disable mirroring the claims under `ext`

By default, all custom claims will be mirrored in the `ext` claim (as is the case with the claim `some_custom_claim` in the
example above).

Set `oauth2.mirror_top_level_claims` to `false` to disable mirroring the claims in the nested `ext` claim:

```shell
ory patch oauth2-config --project <project-id> --workspace <workspace-id> \
  --replace "/oauth2/mirror_top_level_claims=false"
```

This results in an access token with the following structure:

```json
{
  "sub": "...",
  // ...
  "some_custom_claim": "some_custom_value"
  // no "ext" claim
  // ...
}
```
