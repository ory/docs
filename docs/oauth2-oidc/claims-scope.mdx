In this document you will learn how OpenID Connect scope and claims work with Ory OAuth2 and OpenID Connect. It will also cover
the default setup of Ory, which uses Ory Identities for logging in and the Ory Account Experience for getting user consent. This
setup supports the `email` and `profile` OpenID Connect scopes.

## The default setup of Ory OAuth2 and OpenID Connect

By default, Ory OAuth2 and OpenID Connect use Ory Identities to handle login. It also uses the Ory Account Experience to ask for
user consent. This setup supports the `email` and `profile` scopes as defined by OpenID Connect.

### How the `email` scope works

For the `email` scope, the system uses the verifiable addresses of a user. The first verifiable email is used to include the email
in the ID token claims. This means that both `email_verified` and `email` claims get set.

### How the `profile` scope works

For the `profile` scope, the system uses traits associated with a user. Here's how they map:

- `identity.traits.username` is used for the `username` claim.
- `identity.traits.website` is used for the `website` claim.
- `identity.updated_at` is used for the `updated_at` claim.

Also, the name field can be a string or an object:

- If `identity.traits.name` is a string, it is used for the `name` claim.
- If `identity.traits.name` is an object, `traits.name.first` and `traits.name.last` are used for the `given_name` and
  `family_name` traits.

## Customize Scopes and Claims

Refer to the documentation about [OAuth2 webhooks](../hydra/guides/oauth2-webhooks.mdx) to learn about adding custom claims to
your tokens for different OAuth flows.

For full control over the resource owner's user experience during the consent phase in the Authorizatio Code / OpenID Connect
flow, check out the [Ory Consent UI](./custom-login-consent/flow.mdx) documentation.
