Ory Network is a global, planet-spanning system with data distributed across numerous continents. To enhance query performance,
Ory's APIs offer robust consistency controls. This article will delve into the consistency levels provided by Ory's APIs and how
they can be utilized to balance data freshness and latency.

## Consistency Levels

Ory Network offers two distinct consistency levels: `full` and `eventual`.

### Full Consistency

**Definition**: The `full` consistency level ensures that you receive the freshest data available.

**Characteristics**:

- **Data Freshness**: Full consistency guarantees that you receive the latest updates to the data.
- **Latency**: However, this level introduces higher latency to your queries, as the system takes the necessary steps to
  synchronize and deliver the most recent information.
- **Use Cases**: Use `full` consistency when access to the most up-to-date data is critical, even if it means longer
  response times.

### Eventual Consistency

**Definition**: The `eventual` consistency level delivers data as fast as possible.

**Characteristics**:

- **Data Freshness**: While `eventual` consistency offers faster query response times, the data can be stale, meaning it
  does not reflect the latest updates.
- **Latency**: This level minimizes latency, enabling rapid access to data.
- **Use Cases**: Choose `eventual` consistency when immediate data access is crucial, and you can tolerate data that is
  momentarily less current.

## Replication Lag

It's important to note that Ory Network operates with a replication lag of approximately 4.8 seconds. This means that even under
`full` consistency, there is still a delay in accessing the latest data due to the replication process. In some
cases, replication lag can be higher.

## Identity List API Support

The [Identity List API(../reference/api#tag/identity/operation/listIdentities) in Ory Network supports consistency controls. This means you can choose the consistency level when using the Identity List API.

## Conclusion

Understanding the consistency levels offered by Ory's APIs is essential for optimizing query performance in a
global system where data is distributed across continents. By choosing the appropriate consistency level, you can strike the right
balance between data freshness and query latency, ensuring that your application functions effectively in the Ory Network
environment.
