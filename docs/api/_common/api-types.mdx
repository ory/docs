There are two main API types available in Ory:

- Admin APIs, which are often used by the application backend, offer privileged access that's not available to end users. To use
  Admin APIs, you need an Ory Network API Key.
- Public APIs, which are often used by the application frontend, don't require an Ory Network API Key because:
  - they don't require authorization and can be accessed by any client, for example, an application's login page
  - they implement a protocol that defines what authorization mechanism must be used, for example, OAuth2 Client Credentials

Both APIs are available at your project's domain:

```
https://{project.slug}.projects.oryapis.com

# When you use a custom domain with Ory:
# https://ory.your-custom-domain.com
```

This endpoint is your SDK URL. Use it when configuring Ory SDKs and tools.

```typescript
import { Configuration, IdentityApi } from "@ory/client"

const identity = new IdentityApi(
  new Configuration({
    basePath: "https://ory.your-custom-domain.com",
    baseOptions: {
      withCredentials: true,
    },
  }),
)
```
