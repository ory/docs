There are two main API types available in Ory:

- Admin APIs, which are often used by the application backend, offer privileged access that's not available to end users. To use
  Admin APIs, you need an Ory Network API Key.

  Read [Authorization with API Keys](../../concepts/personal-access-token.mdx) to learn more about API Keys in the Ory Network.

  :::

- Public APIs, which are often used by the application frontend, don't require an Ory Network API key because:
  - they don't require authorization and can be accessed by any client, for example, an application's login page.
  - they implement a protocol that defines what authorization mechanism must be used, for example, OAuth2 Client Credentials.

Both APIs are available at your project's domain:

```
https://$PROJECT_SLUG.projects.oryapis.com

# When you use a custom domain with Ory:
# https://ory.your-custom-domain.com
```

This endpoint is your SDK URL. Use it when configuring Ory SDKs and tools.

```typescript
import { Configuration, IdentityApi } from "@ory/client"

const identity = new IdentityApi(
  new Configuration({
    basePath: "https://ory.your-custom-domain.com",
    baseOptions: {
      withCredentials: true,
    },
  }),
)
```
