Ory offers two principal types of APIs:

- Backend / admin APIs offer privileged access, for example deleting identities. To use Admin APIs, you need a Ory Network API
  Key.
- Frontend APIs do not require a Ory Network API Key because:
  - they do not need authorization and can be accessed by any client (e.g. a login page)
  - they implement a protocol which defines what authorization mechanism to use (e.g. OAuth2 Client Credentials).

Both APIs are available at your project's (custom) domain:

```
https://{project.slug}.projects.oryapis.com

# When you own a custom domain:
# https://ory.your-custom-domain.com
```

The endpoint above is your SDK URL, and you will need to use it when configuring Ory SDKs and tools.

```typescript
import { Configuration, IdentityApi } from "@ory/client"

const identity = new IdentityApi(
  new Configuration({
    basePath: "https://ory.your-custom-domain.com",
    baseOptions: {
      withCredentials: true,
    },
  }),
)
```
