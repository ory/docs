## Postman API Reference Collections

> Note that while we try to keep the collections up to date, they might be
> outdated. Please open an [issue](https://github.com/ory/docs/) if that is the
> case.

First, you have to install the Postman App for Windows, Mac, or Chrome. You can
find it on the [Postman Apps](https://www.getpostman.com/apps) page.

Visit the [Ory Postman Public Workspace](https://www.postman.com/ory-docs) and
select the Collection you want to use and import it or select the Ory project
you want to run below:

[![Run Ory Hydra in Postman](../../static/img/docs/postmanHydra.svg)](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/12423954-d820ed2c-b119-44df-8b3e-4f344d8aa03a?action=collection%2Ffork&collection-url=entityId%3D12423954-d820ed2c-b119-44df-8b3e-4f344d8aa03a%26entityType%3Dcollection%26workspaceId%3Dba1e6798-1497-4918-a896-cac2f90d481b)

[![Run Ory Kratos in Postman](../../static/img/docs/postmanKratos.svg)](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/12423954-3497f685-0b0b-4075-81a5-14f317d2ad09?action=collection%2Ffork&collection-url=entityId%3D12423954-3497f685-0b0b-4075-81a5-14f317d2ad09%26entityType%3Dcollection%26workspaceId%3Dba1e6798-1497-4918-a896-cac2f90d481b)

[![Run Ory Keto in Postman](../../static/img/docs/postmanKeto.svg)](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/12423954-890f43c0-e175-4237-8ec4-64ecd2904f49?action=collection%2Ffork&collection-url=entityId%3D12423954-890f43c0-e175-4237-8ec4-64ecd2904f49%26entityType%3Dcollection%26workspaceId%3Dba1e6798-1497-4918-a896-cac2f90d481b)

[![Run Ory Oathkeeper in Postman](../../static/img/docs/postmanOathkeeper.svg)](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/12423954-8c811fa9-6666-499b-b5a6-71d059274dbf?action=collection%2Ffork&collection-url=entityId%3D12423954-8c811fa9-6666-499b-b5a6-71d059274dbf%26entityType%3Dcollection%26workspaceId%3Dba1e6798-1497-4918-a896-cac2f90d481b)

Our API Collections are built directly from the swagger specification (you can
find it at the path `/spec/api.json`) and are organized into folders that
categorize the various API calls.

For example, in the Ory Kratos collection, you will find all calls related to
`identities` in the folder with the same name.

To be able to work with the collection you need to set the `baseURl` variable.
For example, when running Ory Kratos as configured, the `baseURl` needs to be
set to the public endpoint(in the
[Quickstart](https://www.ory.sh/kratos/docs/quickstart) it
is`http://127.0.0.1:4433/`).

You may also have to configure query parameters or the JSON method body,
depending on the API call.

:::info

Do not store tokens in Postman as environment variables!  
If you are signed in to the Postman application, it will automatically try to
synchronize Collections and Environments with the Postman servers. This means
that a token, which could allow someone else access to your APIs, is being
uploaded to Postman's servers.  
Postman has taken measures to ensure that tokens are encrypted and encourages
users to store them in Environment Variables. Read more
[here](https://www.postman.com/security).
