title: Roadmap
---

Ory is actively being developed. The [maturity of our software](./versioning.md)
varies from product to product.

Users are often asking when a particular feature will be implemented or when it
can be expected to be available.

This document strives to give an answer to those questions and give you an
outlook of what is happening in the Ory ecosystem. Please note that this roadmap
is mainly focused on the Ory Open Source libraries - but this also influences
the development of the Ory Cloud.

## Ory Roadmap

If you are interested in a particular project, it is best to check out the
[milestones and open issues & pull requests ](#milestones-issues-pull-requests)
for that project.

Please note that **our roadmap is subject to changes**. This means that
development is considering feedback both from the Open Source community as well
as the Ory Cloud users.

Issues on GitHub are not hard and fixed commitments. GitHub Issues, Milestones,
and Discussions are general guidelines and efforts to make development at Ory as
transparent as possible to facilitate collaboration, trust, and visibility.

## Feedback

If you are a user of our Open Source offering and you have feedback, please do
so in [GitHub Discussions](#discussions) or directly on the
[Community Slack](https://slack.ory.sh/).

Please also vote on issues and discussions with a thumbs up. We will ask for
community feedback on important changes and consider the popularity of features
in the community when planning development.

## Bugs

Every release from Ory includes new features as well as bug fixes. You can find
a full changelog in the main directory of every project (e.g.
[ for Ory Kratos](https://github.com/ory/kratos/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md))

If you happen to find a bug, please open an
[issue](#milestones-issues-pull-requests) in the relevant repository. We
appreciate it when you include steps for replication, version information, logs,
and as much information as you think is helpful. This makes squashing that pesky
bug much easier for us.

We prioritize bug fixes based on the impact of the issue, how many users are
affected, estimated effort, and other factors.

## I want that feature now, how can I make it happen?

First, you should check if an [issue](#milestones-issues-pull-requests) or a
[discussion](#discussions) for that feature already exists.

If it does not exist, please open a [discussion](#discussions) in the "Ideas"
section and try to formulate as accurately as possible what you are trying to
do, what you are expecting how it should work, as well as any technical details
that are relevant. This helps others to understand your idea and maintainers
will discuss the next steps with you.

If it does exist, feel free to voice your support for that feature or open a
road to implementation. Generally, there are several things you can do to
getting a feature implemented faster:

- Contribute

If you think that you can contribute to that particular feature, maintainers
will do their best to give you the right pointers and review PRs. We also really
appreciate non-code contributions, i.e. documentation, feedback, ideas, ...

For more information please refer to the projects CONTRIBUTING.md (e.g. for
[Ory Kratos](https://github.com/ory/kratos/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)).

- Support Ory

If writing code yourself is not an option, you can consider becoming an Ory
Sponsor on [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/ory) or
[Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/_ory). This helps us to employ more
maintainers and technical staff - increasing velocity in development, community,
interaction, and other areas!

All collected money goes directly into open source development.
