If you want to list,create, update or delete identities, manually create recovery links and generally use the Ory CLI to manage your project, you need to access the Ory administrative APIs.

To access administrative APIs at Ory you need to authenticate as administrator. 

Ory offers Personal Access Tokens to make this process easier for development, such as accessing the admin API from the command line or through scripts.

These Personal Access Tokens are bound to a project, they do not work for other projects than the one they have been created for.
Every member can create many, but not unlimited, personal access tokens. 

When creating a token you must give it a description to help you remember what you created the token for.

It helps to name the token after the function it performs or after the person that uses it, but the name can be freely chosen.

To see detailed instructions how to create and use Personal Access Tokens, refer to the [Create Personal Access Tokens Guide](../guides/create-personal-access-tokens)
