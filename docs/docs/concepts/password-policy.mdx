title: Password Policy
---

Password-based authentication flows are subject to frequent abuse through social
engineering, password guessing and phishing attacks.  
Ory Cloud implements measures to provide high security for password-based flows.
The Ory Cloud password policy follows standards by the _National Cyber Security
Centre_
([`NCSC`](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/passwords/updating-your-approach))
and _National Institute of Standards and Technology_
([`NIST`](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html)) as well as

security researchers.

### Default Password Policy

- The password must by default at least be 8 characters long and all characters
  (unicode, ASCII) are allowed.
- Ory Cloud makes sure the password is not similar to the username/email or
  other credentials.  
  To ensure the password is different, Ory Cloud enforces a minimum
  [Levenshtein distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance). It
  also makes sure no significant strings of the credentials are part of the
  password. For example if an users email is `bob@example.com`, `bob24` would
  not be a valid password.
- Ory Cloud checks all passwords against a database of known leaked passwords
  through the [`HIBP`](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) API.  
  Breached or leaked password detection uses anonymized data.
- Ory Cloud does not require or prohibit a mixture or repeated characters
  following to [`NIST`](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html)
  guidelines.

For a more detailed explanation on why this is the default password policy for
Ory Cloud please visit the
[Security Profiles document](https://www.ory.sh/kratos/docs/next/concepts/security/#password-policy/).

### Custom User Interface

When using your
[own user interface](https://www.ory.sh/kratos/docs/next/concepts/ui-user-interface),
we recommend the following password policies to ensure security and good user
experience:

- Allows the pasting of credentials in login etc. forms.
- Allow making the password visible through a modal.
- Do not show password hints to unauthenticated users.
- Do not expire passwords.

[Security Profiles document](https://www.ory.sh/kratos/docs/next/concepts/security/#user-interface-guidelines).
