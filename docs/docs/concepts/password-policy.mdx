title: Password Policy
---

Password-based authentication flows are subject to frequent abuse through social
engineering, password guessing and phishing attacks.  
Ory Cloud implements measures to provide high security for password-based
flows.  
The Ory Cloud password policy is based on recommendations by the
[`NIST`](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html) and
[`NCSC`](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/passwords/updating-your-approach)
institutes among
[others](https://www.troyhunt.com/passwords-evolved-authentication-guidance-for-the-modern-era/).

- The password must at least be 8 characters long and all characters (unicode,
  ASCII) must be allowed.
- Ory Cloud makes sure the password is not similar to the username/email or
  other credentials.  
  To ensure the password is different, Ory Cloud enforces a minimum
  [Levenshtein distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance)
  (measuring how much two strings resemble each other). It also makes sure no
  significant strings of the credentials are part of the password.
- Ory Cloud checks all passwords against the
  [`HIBP`](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) API.  
  `HIBP` provides a open database of leaked passwords. Every password sent to
  `HIBP` is SHA-1 hashed and anonymized, so there is no compromise of user
  credentials.
- Ory Cloud does not require or prohibit a mixture or repeated characters.

### Custom User Interface

When using your
[own user interface](https://www.ory.sh/kratos/docs/next/concepts/ui-user-interface),
we recommend the following password policies to ensure security and good user
experience:

- Allows the pasting of credentials in login etc. forms.
- Allow making the password visible through a modal.
- Do not show password hints to unauthenticated users.
- Do not expire passwords.
