# Terminology

An overview of the terminology used in the Ory Cloud documentation.  
If you think a term is missing here, please
[let us know](https://github.com/ory/docs/issues/new).

## Basics

#### End-User

The person who actually uses a Web-App, SPA, or mobile App that uses Ory Cloud.

#### Identity

The "who" of the application. This can be an employee, customer, external
developer, or a programmatic identity like an IoT device, application, or
another kind of machine actor. Other often used aliases include "user",
"account", or "user account".

#### Self-services

Interfaces and flows in the Ory Cloud that allow end-users to consume services
without the direct involvement of service employees. A common example would be
when someone signs up for a service without interacting directly to support.

#### Browser Client:

End-user side. A browser client refers to the Web browser in the user's machine
or mobile device.

#### API Client:

End-user side. A browser client refers to the Web browser in the user's machine
or mobile device.

## Flows

#### Registration Flow:

The path that a user has to take in order to create an identity at your
application.

#### Login Flow:

The path that a user has to take in order to authenticate (i.e. prove they are a
certain identity) at your application.
