Ory Cloud Projects are isolated tenants providing functionality, user
interfaces, and APIs around identities, sessions, login, and many more.

Internally, Ory Cloud Projects run our popular open source projects in a
multi-tenant environment in a highly scalable, low-latency, and reliable way.
Ory Cloud Projects include additional services (e.g. dashboards, security, SLAs,
...) which are not available in the open source.
