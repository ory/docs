title: No-Code with Ory Proxy
---

The Ory Proxy (`ory proxy --help`) is a CLI command which allows for a basic
no-code integration of Ory.

:::note

Learn how to [install the Ory CLI](./ory-cli-install-use.mdx) on your
development machine.

:::

## Local Development

The Ory Proxy works great for local development. It does so by registering a SSL
certificate in your operating system's credential store when starting up.

:::warning

FireFox uses its own certificate storage. If you encounter problems with FireFox
[please raise an issue](https://github.com/ory/platform/issues/new).

:::

This is to ensure that all cookies work correctly in your development
environment.

A list of all available options can be found in the
[Ory CLI Reference](../cli/ory.md).

## Production Deployment

The Ory Proxy is not yet available for production deployments.
