title: Using Ory Proxy
---

Ory Proxy is a powerful tool which authenticates users, converts session into a
JSON Web Token, and ensures that cookies and URLs are properly configured.

Using Ory Cloud without Ory Proxy is currently not encouraged, unless you are
writing a mobile application or are only interacting with Ory Cloud's Admin
APIs.

If you haven't already, please
[install the Ory CLI](../start-building/ory-cli-install-use.mdx) on your
development machine or server.

## Concepts

Before heading into the concrete examples, let's look at some of Ory Proxy's
concepts.

### URL Structure

Ory Proxy mirrors Ory Cloud's APIs and UIs under the `/.ory` path. If you were
to call, for example, the URL
`https://<your-project-slug>.projects.oryapis.com/ui/login`, the equivalent
proxied URL would be `https://<proxy-host>/.ory/ui/login`.

Ory Proxy has a few shorthand URLs which you can use to initiate self-service
flows:

- `/.ory/self-service/login/browser` initiates the self-service login flow.
- `/.ory/self-service/registration/browser` initiates the self-service
  registration flow.
- `/.ory/self-service/recovery/browser` initiates the self-service recovery
  flow.
- `/.ory/self-service/verification/browser` initiates the self-service
  verification flow.
- `/.ory/self-service/settings/browser` initiates the self-service settings
  flow.

If you redirect or link the user to one of those paths, the login, registration,
... flow will be initiated:

```html
<a href="/.ory/self-service/login/browser">Log in</a>
```

You can also append a `return_to` query parameter so that the user ends up at
that URL. Please keep in mind that the domain MUST be an allow-listed URL in the
Ory Cloud Project configuration!

The return_to URL must include the protocol and domain! Relative URLs are not
possible.

```html
<a
  href="/.ory/self-service/login/browser?return_to=https://localhost:4000/my-url"
  >Log in</a
>
```

### Zero Trust

Ory Proxy translates any known Ory credentials (e.g. Ory Session Token or Ory
Session Cookie) to a JSON Web Token. Assuming the user calls Ory Proxy with a
valid Ory Session Cookie

```
GET /some-path
Host: localhost:4000
Cookie: ory_session_jollyproskuriakovaxe98qw5t8g=MTYyNzU1OTgyNHxEdi1CQkFFQ180SUFBUkFCRUFBQVJfLUNBQUVHYzNSeWFXNW5EQThBRFhObGMzTnBiMjVmZEc5clpXNEdjM1J5YVc1bkRDSUFJR3RGU1d4dlUwOXVSR2w1UjJONmFVRlhaWEIxWVhCVlNHWlZOVTQxWWtGMnwhbFZh8BCCQ3tMemDczrB9-epefXl1E7whiChUt62LuA==

...
```

Ory Proxy resolves that session and converts it to a JSON Web Token which is
included in the HTTP Request's `Authorization` Header which is made to the
"upstream" (the URL which Ory Proxy is protecting). The session cookie will
still be included in the request, in case that you need it to generate a logout
URL for example.

```
GET /some-path
Host: <your-application>:3000
Authorization: eyJhbGciOiJFUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.6vvdyNkNce39W8WPKwF5QUTOlBjF5VW6Xl3QzYHU9M1riiDVgQ4rK8XHEqcjhAQcis8EIbRm7K0UuLNGwKsKzQ",

```

We strongly encourage you to validate the JSON Web Token using Ory Proxy's
public key. The public key is available at `/.ory/proxy/jwks.json`:

```
$ curl -sk https://<proxy-host>/.ory/proxy/jwks.json | jq
{
  "keys": [
    {
      "use": "sig",
      "kty": "EC",
      "kid": "f8f2e6ff-0480-4343-9dee-0d2a463146dc",
      "crv": "P-256",

      "y": "7XaYgYsW-Mjb5qIq47LxyaPHjPZfRHRnnfir8aqd9BU"
    }
  ]
}
```

If you do now know how to validate a JSON Web Token, head over to the
[Server-Side Web App](../start-building/server-side-web-app.mdx) documentation
page.

Using the public key, you can validate and decode the JSON Web Token, which
includes all the session and identity information linked to the Ory Session
Cookie:

## Ory Proxy for Local Development

Before you start set the environment variable
[`ORY_SDK_URL`](../concepts/terminology#ory-sdk-url). It can be found in the
"API & Services" section of your Ory Cloud Console.

Ory Proxy works great on local machines (`localhost`). Assuming you are running,
for example, a NodeJS app on port 3000, you would point Ory Proxy to that URL:

```
export ORY_SDK_URL=https://<project>.projects.oryapis.com/
ory proxy http://localhost:3000
```

For more information on other CLI flags run `ory help proxy` or head over to the
[Ory Proxy Local Reference](../cli/ory-proxy.md).

## Ory Proxy for Production

Ory Proxy is also capable of protecting remote and production environments.
Alternatively you can also use [DNS CNAME](./custom-domains.mdx). The only
difference to running the proxy locally, is that you append the root URL where
your app (via Ory Proxy) is exposed at:

```
export ORY_SDK_URL=https://<project>.projects.oryapis.com/
ory proxy http://localhost:3000 https://my-domain.com
```

For other CLI flags which, for example, disable the auto-opening of the URL in
the browser, run `ory help proxy` or head over to the
[Ory Proxy Production Reference](../cli/ory-proxy.md).

### Running on a VM

If you are deploying on a VM, Virtual or Dedicated Server using Ory Proxy is
easy! Just run your application server and the proxy in parallel. Assuming you
are using NodeJS to run your server on port 3000, and are exposing web traffic
at port 8080, use:

```
ory proxy --port 8080 http://127.0.0.1:3000 https://your-domain.com &

# This should be your server command
node your-entrypoint.js

# Could also be something like:
#   go run main.go
#   php index.php
#   ...
```

### Running in Docker

One option is to add both Ory Proxy and your service to a Docker container.

:::warning

Running two processes in one Docker Container is problematic as Docker will only
watch the process running in the foreground. If the process in the background
crashes, Docker will not be notified. To get a more stable system in place,
please follow
[Run multiple services in a container](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/multi-service_container/).

For simplicity we have chosen to run Ory Proxy as a background task here!

:::

To run Ory Proxy alongside your application, create a file called
`entrypoint.sh` with a content along the lines of:

```shell
#!/bin/bash
set -e

# This assumes that your server is running on port 3000. If it is running on a different port,
# change the `3000` to the port where your server is running at!
ory proxy --port 8080 http://127.0.0.1:3000 https://your-domain.com &

# This should be your server command
node your-entrypoint.js
# Could also be something like:
#   go run main.go
#   php index.php
#   ...
```

Then, add the script to your Dockerfile and run it:

```Dockerfile
# ...

EXPOSE 8080

COPY ./docker-entrypoint.sh /
ENTRYPOINT ["/docker-entrypoint.sh"]
```

### Kubernetes

Adding a Helm Chart for Ory Proxy is on the roadmap, which would allow running
Ory Proxy either as a Service, Ingress, or Side Car!

## Troubleshooting

If you run get an error while working with Ory Proxy or Ory CLI , make sure you
are on the latest version.

- For
  [brew (MacOs)](https://www.ory.sh/docs/start-building/ory-cli-install-use#install-on-macos)
  use `brew upgrade ory/tap/cli`,
- For
  [scoop (Win)](https://www.ory.sh/docs/start-building/ory-cli-install-use#install-on-windows)
  use `scoop update ory`

to update to the latest version. The Ory CLI will autoupdate in the near future.
