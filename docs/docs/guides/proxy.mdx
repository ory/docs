title: Using the Ory Proxy
---

The Ory Proxy is a powerful tool which authenticates users, converts session
into a JSON Web Token, and ensures that cookies and URLs are properly
configured.

Using Ory Cloud without the Ory Proxy is currently not encouraged, unless you
are writing a mobile application or are only interacting with Ory Cloud's Admin
APIs.

If you haven't already, please
[install the Ory CLI](../start-building/ory-cli-install-use.mdx) on your
development machine or server.

## Concepts

Before heading into the concrete examples, let's look at some of the Ory Proxy's
concepts.

### URL Structure

The Ory Proxy mirrors Ory Cloud's APIs and UIs under the `/.ory` path. If you
were to call, for example, the URL
`https://<your-project-slug>.projects.oryapis.com/ui/login`, the equivalent
proxied URL would be `https://<proxy-host>/.ory/ui/login`.

The Ory Proxy has a few shorthand URLs which you can use to initiate
self-service flows:

- `/.ory/init/login` initiates the self-service login flow.
- `/.ory/init/registration` initiates the self-service registration flow.
- `/.ory/init/recovery` initiates the self-service recovery flow.
- `/.ory/init/verification` initiates the self-service verification flow.
- `/.ory/init/settings` initiates the self-service settings flow.

If you redirect or link the user to one of those paths, the login, registration,
... flow will be initiated:

```html
<a href="/.ory/init/login">Log in</a>
```

You can also append a `return_to` query parameter so that the user ends up at
that URL. Please keep in mind that the domain MUST be an allow-listed URL in the
Ory Cloud Project configuration!

The return_to URL must include the protocol and domain! Relative URLs are not
possible.

```html
<a href="/.ory/init/login?return_to=https://localhost:4000/my-url">Log in</a>
```

### Zero Trust

The Ory Proxy translates any known Ory credentials (e.g. Ory Session Token or
Ory Session Cookie) to a JSON Web Token. Assuming the user calls the Ory Proxy
with a valid Ory Session Cookie

```
GET /some-path
Host: localhost:4000
Cookie: ory_session_jollyproskuriakovaxe98qw5t8g=MTYyNzU1OTgyNHxEdi1CQkFFQ180SUFBUkFCRUFBQVJfLUNBQUVHYzNSeWFXNW5EQThBRFhObGMzTnBiMjVmZEc5clpXNEdjM1J5YVc1bkRDSUFJR3RGU1d4dlUwOXVSR2w1UjJONmFVRlhaWEIxWVhCVlNHWlZOVTQxWWtGMnwhbFZh8BCCQ3tMemDczrB9-epefXl1E7whiChUt62LuA==

...
```

the Ory Proxy resolves that session and converts it to a JSON Web Token which is
included in the HTTP Request's `Authorization` Header which is made to the
"upstream" (the URL which the Ory Proxy is protecting). The session cookie will
still be included in the request, in case that you need it to generate a logout
URL for example.

```
GET /some-path
Host: <your-application>:3000

```

We strongly encourage you to validate the JSON Web Token using the Ory Proxy's
public key. The public key is available at `/.ory/proxy/jwks.json`:

```
$ curl -sk https://<proxy-host>/.ory/proxy/jwks.json | jq
{
  "keys": [
    {
      "use": "sig",
      "kty": "EC",
      "kid": "f8f2e6ff-0480-4343-9dee-0d2a463146dc",
      "crv": "P-256",

      "y": "7XaYgYsW-Mjb5qIq47LxyaPHjPZfRHRnnfir8aqd9BU"
    }
  ]
}
```

If you do now know how to validate a JSON Web Token, head over to the
[Server-Side Web App](../start-building/server-side-web-app.mdx) documentation
page.

Using the public key, you can validate and decode the JSON Web Token, which
includes all the session and identity information linked to the Ory Session
Cookie:

## Ory Proxy for Local Development

The Ory Proxy works great on local machines (`localhost`). It is able to
register SSL certificates in your operating system's credential store when
starting up, allowing for an easy and secure way to start development.

Assuming you are running, for example, a NodeJS app on port 3000, you would
point the Ory Proxy to that URL:

```
export ORY_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your personal access token here>
ory proxy local http://localhost:3000
```

For other CLI flags which, for example, disable the auto-opening of the URL in
the browser, run `ory help proxy local` or head over to the
[Ory Proxy Local Reference](../cli/ory-proxy-local.md).

## Ory Proxy for Production

The Ory Proxy is also capable of protecting remote and production environments.
Alternatively you can also use
[DNS CNAME](../start-building/deploy-auth-production.mdx).

Using the Ory Proxy in production works similar to the local development flow,
with a few differences:

1. The Ory Proxy will not install any SSL certificates. You are responsible for
   setting up HTTPS.
2. You must specify the URL where the proxy is running.

```
export ORY_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your personal access token here>
ory proxy production http://localhost:3000 https://my-domain.com
```

For other CLI flags which, for example, disable the auto-opening of the URL in
the browser, run `ory help proxy production` or head over to the
[Ory Proxy Production Reference](../cli/ory-proxy-local.md).

### Running on a NodeJS PaaS (Vercel, Netlify, Gatsby Cloud, ...)

If you deploy your application on a PaaS such as Vercel, Gatsby Cloud, or
Netlify the best option is to install the Ory CLI using NPM
(`npm i --save @ory/cli`) and run it as part of your NPM start script:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "npm-run-all -p start:*",
    "start:proxy": "ory proxy local --port $PORT http://127.0.0.1:3000 https://your-domain.com",
    "start:server": "node your-entrypoint.js"
  }
}
```

Here we are assuming that your server is running on port 3000. If it is running
on a different port, replace the port number in `http://127.0.0.1:3000`.

Additionally we are assuming that your PaaS is exposing the port on which your
app is running at the environment variable `PORT` and that it is actually
executing `npm run start` and not just using static files!

### Running on a VM

If you are deploying on a VM, Virtual or Dedicated Server using the Ory Proxy is
easy! Just run your application server and the proxy in parallel. Assuming you
are using NodeJS to run your server on port 3000, and are exposing web traffic
at port 8080, use:

```
ory proxy local --port 8080 http://127.0.0.1:3000 https://your-domain.com &

# This should be your server command
node your-entrypoint.js

# Could also be something like:
#   go run main.go
#   php index.php
#   ...
```

### Running in Docker

One option is to add both the Ory Proxy and your service to a Docker container.

:::warning

Running two processes in one Docker Container is problematic as Docker will only
watch the process running in the foreground. If the process in the background
crashes, Docker will not be notified. To get a more stable system in place,
please follow
[Run multiple services in a container](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/multi-service_container/).

For simplicity we have chosen to run the Ory Proxy as a background task here!

:::

To run the Ory Proxy alongside your application, create a file called
`entrypoint.sh` with a content along the lines of:

```shell
#!/bin/bash
set -e

# This assumes that your server is running on port 3000. If it is running on a different port,
# change the `3000` to the port where your server is running at!
ory proxy local --port 8080 http://127.0.0.1:3000 https://your-domain.com &

# This should be your server command
node your-entrypoint.js
# Could also be something like:
#   go run main.go
#   php index.php
#   ...
```

Then, add the script to your Dockerfile and run it:

```Dockerfile
# ...

EXPOSE 8080

COPY ./docker-entrypoint.sh /
ENTRYPOINT ["/docker-entrypoint.sh"]
```

### Kubernetes

Adding a Helm Chart for the Ory Proxy is on the roadmap, which would allow
running the Ory Proxy either as a Service, Ingress, or Side Car!

## Troubleshooting

If you run get an error while working with the Ory Proxy or Ory CLI , make sure
you are on the latest version.

- For
  [brew (MacOs)](https://www.ory.sh/docs/start-building/ory-cli-install-use#install-on-macos)
  use `brew upgrade ory`,
- For
  [scoop (Win)](https://www.ory.sh/docs/start-building/ory-cli-install-use#install-on-windows)
  use `scoop update ory`

to update to the latest version. The Ory CLI will autoupdate in the near future.
