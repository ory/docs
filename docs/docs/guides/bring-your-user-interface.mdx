title: Bring Your Own UI
---

Ory provides a "managed UI" for essential pages such as User Login, User
Registration, Account Recovery / Password Reset, Account Verification / Email
Verification, User Settings, and more. The Managed UI will be customizable in
the future.

Further, Ory is an API-first service. Implementing these pages in your language
and framework of choice is straightforward using our SDKs.

Unless you are building a [Native App](#native-apps), you will need to configure
the endpoints where your UI pages for the individual flows (login, registration,
...) are located.

If you leave fields empty, the Ory cloud Managed UI will be used for that flow.

Let's say you have an app hosted at `https://www.example.org` with a login
screen at `https://www.example.org/login` but have no other screens implemented
yet? Your configuration would look as follows:

:::note

If you are unsure how to set up your Ory Cloud Project to be connected to your
domain (e.g. `example.org`), head over to
[Get Ready for Production](../start-building/deploy-auth-production.mdx).

All other flows (registration, settings, verification, recovery, error) would
still use Ory Cloud's managed UI!

## Reference Implementations and Guided Examples

We have several reference implementations and guides available for building your
own login, registration, ... user interface and forms on top of Ory's APIs:

- [Add Custom Login, Registration, User Settings to Your Next.js & React Single Page Application (SPA)](https://www.ory.sh/nextjs-authentication-spa-custom-flows-open-source/)
- [NodeJS / ExpressJS UI Reference Implementation](https://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-node)
- [React Native UI Reference Implementation](https://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-react-native)

## Development

If you are developing locally, you can set the configuration to, for example,
`http://localhost:1234/login`. To make this work, you will need to use the
[Ory Proxy](./proxy.mdx) locally!

## Native Apps

Native Apps refer to applications that do not have a browser, such as React
Native, Swift, Android SDK, and others.

You can interface with Ory's Cloud APIs to build your own UI for native apps
today. Behind the scenes, we are using Ory Kratos to provide the features around
login, registration, recovery, verification, and account settings.

[Getting Started with React Native](../start-building/native-mobile-app.mdx#react-native)
guide!

## Technical Concepts and APIs

Behind the scenes, Ory Cloud is powered by Open Source Ory Kratos. To learn more
about the technical details of how the (login, registration, ...) flows work and
