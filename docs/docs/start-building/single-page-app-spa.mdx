Ory supports server-side web apps natively. To get building, pick the technology
you are using:

- [React Native](#react-native)
- [Android](./other-languages.mdx)
- [iOS Swift](./other-languages.mdx)
- [Cordova](./other-languages.mdx)
- [smartTV](./other-languages.mdx)
- [Ionic](./other-languages.mdx)
- [Windows](./other-languages.mdx)

## React Native

While a guide for React Native is not yet available for Ory Cloud, you can check
out the React Native guide and code example for Open Source Ory Kratos, which is
powering Ory Cloud's identity features.

- [Add Authentication to your React Native App](https://www.ory.sh/login-react-native-authentication-example-api/)
- React Native integration on
  [GitHub](https://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-react-native)

The guide and examples are already using the Ory Cloud playground object. If you
have your own object, all you need to do is replace the project slug!
