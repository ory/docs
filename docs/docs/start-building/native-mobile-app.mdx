Ory supports native and mobile apps natively. To get building, pick the
technology you are using:

- [React Native](#react-native)
- [Android](./other-languages.mdx)
- [iOS Swift](./other-languages.mdx)
- [Cordova](./other-languages.mdx)
- [smartTV](./other-languages.mdx)
- [Ionic](./other-languages.mdx)
- [Windows](./other-languages.mdx)

For more information on the Ory Cloud SDK and Services and please see the
[Services & APIs docs](../concepts/services-api.mdx).

## React Native

The
[React Native example](http://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-react-native)
and its
[accompanying guide](https://www.ory.sh/login-react-native-authentication-example-api/)
are using Ory Cloud's playground project to showcase how adding Ory to native
apps works. You can download and try out this app from the
[Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ory-profile-app/id1536546333)
and
[Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ory.kratos_self_service_ui_react_native&hl=en&gl=US).

If you have an Ory Cloud Project, try entering your Ory Cloud Project's slug in
the "Project" text field.

<p>
  <img
    alt="Enter the Project Slug in the Ory Profile App"
    src={useBaseUrl('/img/docs/project-selection.jpeg')}
    width="60%"
    align="center"
    style={{ margin: '0 auto', display: 'block' }}
  />
</p>

To get the Ory Cloud Project slug head over to
[Services & APIs](../concepts/services-api.mdx) and copy the SDK Configuration.
The slug is the part between `https://` and `projects.oryapis.com`. For example,
given the following SDK URL

```
https://jolly-proskuriakova-xf13qw5t8g.projects.oryapis.com
```

the slug would be

```
jolly-proskuriakova-xf13qw5t8g
```

Feel free to use our React Native repository as the starting point for your
application! It is licensed as Apache 2.0, which means that you can customize
and also sell it :)
