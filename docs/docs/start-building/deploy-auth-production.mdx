To elevate your development project to production, or any other remote
environment, you have two options:

- Use the [Ory Proxy](#ory-proxy).
- Set up [DNS CNAME](#cname).

## Ory Proxy

The Ory Proxy offers a convenient and quick way to get your project to
production. Please head over to
[Ory Proxy for Production](../guides/proxy.mdx#ory-proxy-for-production) and
learn how to get your Ory Cloud project to production!

## CNAME

To use a Custom Domain with Ory Cloud, you can set a CNAME record with your DNS
provider. Refer to [Using a Custom Domain](../guides/custom-domains.mdx) for
more information.
