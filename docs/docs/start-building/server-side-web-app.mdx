title: Build a Server-Side Web App with Ory
---

Ory supports server-side web apps natively. To get building, pick the technology
you are using:

- [NodeJS](#expressjs--nodejs) / [ExpressJS](#expressjs--nodejs)
- [Golang](./other-languages.mdx)
- [Java](./other-languages.mdx)
- [PHP](./other-languages.mdx)
- [Django](./other-languages.mdx)
- [Other language / framework](./other-languages.mdx)

Before you get started, please install the [Ory CLI](./ory-cli-install-use.mdx)
on your system, and have a [running Ory Project](../get-started.mdx) and a
[Personal Access Token](../guides/create-personal-access-token.mdx) ready.

## ExpressJS / NodeJS

This example uses NodeJS with TypeScript support and ExpressJS to set up an app
with two endpoints:

- `/`: can be accessed without an active Ory Session;
- `/public`: can be accessed without an active Ory Session;
- `/protected`: can only be accessed after registration / login - with an active
  Ory Session.

:::note

You can find this
[example's source code on GitHub](https://github.com/ory/docs/tree/master/examples/typescript-express).

:::

To get started open a new terminal and set the environment variables:

- `ORY_ACCESS_TOKEN`: Use a personal access token here

```shell
export ORY_ACCESS_TOKEN=...
# e.g.
# export ORY_ACCESS_TOKEN=2123l8jJhSIYQZvfasd53YoRvcseg1
```

To get started, check out the example's source code, install the node packages,
and run the app:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/ory/docs.git
cd docs/examples/typescript-express
npm i

export ORY_ACCESS_TOKEN=...
# e.g.
# export ORY_ACCESS_TOKEN=2123l8jJhSIYQZvfasd53YoRvcseg1

## ATTENTION ##
# Node, similar to Firefox, does not use the Operating System Certificate store.
# To get the self-signed SSL certificates working, we need to disable TLS Verification.
# NEVER, EVER do this in a live system.
export NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0

npm start
```

Open another terminal and copy set the `ORY_ACCESS_TOKEN` env var to your
Personal Access Token:

```shell
export ORY_ACCESS_TOKEN=...
```

Next, run the Ory Proxy with

- `--port 4000`: the port on which the proxy should listen on;
- `http://localhost:8000/`: the host and port of the NodeJS app you are
  protecting.

```shell
ory proxy local \
  --port 4000 \
  http://localhost:8000/
```

Your operating system will prompt you for your administrative password. The Ory
Proxy sets up a temporary SSL certificate in your operating system's certificate
store to enable HTTPS integration.

:::warning

The registration of the self-signed SSL certificate works only in Chrome and
Safari but not yet in Firefox. Also, programming languages like Golang, NodeJS,
and others often do not respect the operating system certificate store. In those
cases, you must disable TLS verification. This is not an issue in production!

:::

To see what the app can do, open it at the original endpoints:

- [localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/)
- [localhost:8000/protected](http://localhost:8000/protected)

The second URL `/protected` will greet you with an error because no Ory Session
is available.

However, if you open the URL through the proxy at
[https://localhost:4000/protected](https://localhost:4000/protected), your
browser will be redirected to a login screen! Once you created an account or
signed in, the application will show information about the session:

### Code Examples

import CodeFromRemote from '@theme/CodeFromRemote'

To get the app integrated with Ory, we use the following `npm` dependencies:

- [`@ory/client`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ory/client) contains the Ory
  SDK. While not needed, the app includes an example of how to set up the SDK
  and use it;
- [`dotenv`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) loads environment variables
  from a `.env` file;
- [`express-jwt`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-jwt) is an express
  middleware for JWTs;
- [`jwks-rsa`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jwks-rsa) a library to load the
  cryptographic keys for verifying JWTs using a remote URL.

Let's take a look at the annotated code!

#### Root App

All you need is a plain ExpressJS skeleton:

<CodeFromRemote
  lang="js"
  link="https://github.com/ory/docs/blob/master/examples/typescript-express/src/index.ts"
  src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ory/docs/master/examples/typescript-express/src/index.ts"
/>

#### Middleware

The Ory Session Cookie is converted to a JSON Web Token by `ory proxy local`.
The cryptographic key to verify the JSON Web Token is available at
`https://<proxy>/.ory/proxy/.well-known`.

If the JSON Web Token is not available, or not valid, we redirect to the login:

<CodeFromRemote
  lang="js"
  link="https://github.com/ory/docs/blob/master/examples/typescript-express/src/middleware.ts"
  src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ory/docs/master/examples/typescript-express/src/middleware.ts"
/>

#### Protected Page

The protected page is doing a few extra things, such as fetching the identity
from Ory Cloud's Administrative APIs, and also creates a logout URL for the
user:

<CodeFromRemote
  lang="js"
  link="https://github.com/ory/docs/blob/master/examples/typescript-express/src/routes/protected.ts"
  src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ory/docs/master/examples/typescript-express/src/routes/protected.ts"
/>

### Conclusion

Great! You've made it! Integrating Ory is easy and straight forward. There are
many more things to come, and we are excited to have you on board!
