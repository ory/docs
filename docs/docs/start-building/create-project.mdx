## Create Personal Access Token

Note that a personal access token is required to access administrative APIs
(e.g. deleting an identity, using the Ory CLI, ...). Personal Access Tokens are
bound to a project.

Head over to the
[Personal Access Tokens concept documentation](../concepts/personal-access-token.mdx)
to learn more.

## What's next?

You created your first Ory Cloud Project. Now it's time to
[start building](./start-building.mdx)!
