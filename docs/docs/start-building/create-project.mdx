title: Create Ory Cloud Project
---

This guide describes the practical steps to create an Ory Cloud Project.

If you want to learn more about Ory Cloud Projects, please visit the
[concepts](../concepts/project.mdx) documentation.

## Set up Ory account

If you haven't already, sign up at the Ory Cloud Console:
[console.ory.sh](https://console.ory.sh)

## Create Ory Cloud Project

:::info

Ory Cloud is currently in [early access](./early-access.mdx) and invite-only. To
create an Ory Cloud Project,
[register and apply for Ory Early Access](https://console.ory.sh/). Once Ory is
in [Open Beta](../early-access#roadmap), this will no longer be needed. :::

Hit "Create Project" in the Console menu to bring up the project creation
screen.

### Project Name

![Ory Cloud Project creation screen](../images/get-started/project-create-details.png)

Enter a project name to identify the project. This name is only visible in the
Ory Cloud Console.

### Identity Schema

![Choose Identity Schema for Ory Cloud Project](../images/get-started/project-create-identity-model.png)

The Identity Schema is a JSON Schema that describes your identity's (e.g. your
customers/users/...) fields. In Ory, every identity can have its schema,
allowing you to separate between different customer types, user types (e.g.
employees and customers).

[Learn more about the Identity Schema](concepts/identity.mdx), the available
profiles, and customization options! For the quickstart, we recommend the "Demo
Profile" model.

:::note

The "Demo Profile" is a preset schema for technical demonstrations. Do not use
it in real applications as we will eventually change or delete this profile.

:::

### Authentication Options

![Enable "session after registration" for Ory Cloud Project](../images/get-started/project-create-session-hook.png)

For demo applications, we recommend enabling sign-in after registration.

:::note

Enable sign-in after registration disables account enumeration defenses!

:::

### Finalize Creation

Next, hit "Create" and fill out the details on the checkout page. Your project
should come alive shortly after!

## Create Personal Access Token

Personal Access Tokens are bound to a project. They are needed to access
administrative APIs (e.g. deleting an identity, using the Ory CLI, ...).

Head over to the "Personal Access Token" page

![Personal Access Token list](../images/get-started/pat-list.png)

and click on the plus symbol to create a new token.

Once created, a dialog will appear on the bottom left containing your access
token. Copy this into a password manager or another safe place. The token will
never be displayed again! If you forget it, you will need to create a new token.

To learn more about PATs, visit to the
[Personal Access Token concept documentation](../concepts/personal-access-token.mdx).

:::note

Personal Access Tokens are an interim security mechanism. In the future, more
secure mechanisms such as JWT Assertions and mTLS will be supported.

## What's next?

You created your first Ory Cloud Project. Now it's time to
[start building](./start-building.mdx)!
