Ory is a SaaS platform offering a variety of APIs and services.

## Identity Management

Our identity management, based on the open source
[Ory Kratos](https://www.ory.sh/kratos) project implements everything related to
identities (users):

- **Self-service** flows are everything users do on their own / without the help
  of others:
- Registration with passwords, social sign in, OpenID Connect, ...;
- Login with passwords, social sign in, OpenID Connect, ...;
- Updating the profile, email, changing the password, un/linking with Social
  Sign In providers, ...;
- Recovering the account by resetting the password;
- Verifying email addresses, phone numbers, ...;
- Multi-factor authentication flows and recovery processes;
- **Administrative identity management** to get, create, update, delete
  identities (users) and their data.
- **Headless APIs and data models** allow you to fully customize identity models
  (e.g. adding fields like first name, accept tos, shipping address, gender,
  ...) and create your own login, registration, profile settings, recovery, and
  verification screen using our easy to use SDKs and REST APIs.
