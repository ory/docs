title: Early Access
---

Ory is currently in early access and invite-only. In our book, early access has
the following implications:

1. All services are secure and reliable;
2. APIs and features marked as experimental are subject to sudden change;
3. Feature-parity with the open source has not yet been achieved;

## Limitations

In particular, the following limitations apply for now:

1. All data in the dashboard is synthetic.
2. Personal Access Tokens are an interim solution for accessing our APIs. We
   will be migrating to mTLS and OAuth2 flows where applicable in the future.
3. The Ory Proxy is in pilot phase and does not yet support Let's Encrypt and
   other advanced use cases.
4. While our SRE team is working around the clock, we can currently not provide
   SLAs or availability guarantees.
5. Documentation is lacking.
6. Advanced configuration of Ory Kratos is currently not possible.

## Roadmap

We have several things on the roadmap for this year:

1. Multi-region deployments
2. Multi-Factor Authentication
3. Offering Ory Keto
4. Offering Ory Hydra
5. Managed UI customizability
6. Support configuration options from the open source

This list is going to expand and maintained in the future.
