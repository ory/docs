title: Ory Open Source
---

Ory has an open source architecture, attitude, and heart. We believe in
collaboration, participation, and the open exchange of ideas. We believe that
open source is a fundamental part of modern software development. Open source
allows everyone - regardless of economic background - to build a better world
with software.

Therefore, most of what we do is open source. Our deep commitment and history in
open source software development **is not a marketing ploy**.
[We have spent thousands of work hours, committed hundred of thousands of changes, and published millions lines of code under permissive open source licenses such as MIT and Apache 2.0](https://github.com/ory).

Below you will find our most popular open source projects, their documentation,
and more.
