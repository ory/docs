Ory Cloud is currently in [early access](./early-access.mdx) and invite-only.

Cloud.  
Limited seats, apply today: [console.ory.sh](https://console.ory.sh/).

### Where is the catch

As we are building Ory Cloud as a scalable, managed way to run Ory for
customers, user feedback and constructive exchange with the customer base is
most important to us. Your feedback and usage statistics during the free year of
using Ory Cloud will help us build an even better product.

In an Early Access system, not everything is completely done, but customers are
running on Ory Cloud right now, and we hope we can count you among those early
adopters.

We also want to give back to our open source community and let them experience
the vision we have for Ory Cloud firsthand. It will make clear that a commercial
Ory service will help our open source ecosystem grow and thrive, not work
against it.

### End of Early Access

_The Early Access period ends November 1st, 2022._

After the early access period, you will be automatically notified about a
suitable paying plan, determined by the current resource usage for each of your
projects individually.

This will provide you with high flexibility throughout the different stages:
test, development and production. Every single project will have an individual
paying plan based on the [Open Beta pricing](https://www.ory.sh/pricing/).

### Upgrading to a paid Ory Cloud plan

You can upgrade your Ory Cloud Project at any time after starting the Early
Access. Please reach out to support@ory.sh.

### Costs after Early Access

Ory Cloud charges you only for resources you use. You can estimate the cost of
using Ory Cloud by consulting the [pricing page](https://www.ory.sh/pricing/) or
reaching out to sales@ory.sh. To stop all billable services and prevent your Ory
Cloud Project from incurring charges, you can cancel your Ory Cloud subscription
by visiting the
["Manage My Subscriptions"](https://api.console.ory.sh/backoffice/public/customer/portal)
page in the Ory Cloud Console.
