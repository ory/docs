Ory Cloud is currently in [early access](./early-access.mdx) and invite-only. To
get access to Ory Cloud's full functionality you need to apply for the Ory Cloud
Insider program. Ory Insiders

- have exclusive and unmetered access to Ory Cloud.
- are invited to weekly meetings with Ory's core development team.
- can influence the roadmap and priorities.
- get exclusive Ory swag.

The Ory Insider program is
[priced at 99$ per month](https://www.ory.sh/pricing/). This price does not
reflect the eventual price of using and running Ory as we aim to provide the
most affordable platform out there!

To apply for Ory Insiders, head over to [console.ory.sh](https://console.ory.sh)
and sign up for an account.

## Become an Ory Insider

Once your account is set up, you will be greeted with your projects list.

![Empty Ory projects list](./images/get-started/project-list-empty.png)

Next, [create a project](https://console.ory.sh/projects/create). You will be
prompted for an invite code. If you do not have an invite code but would like to
become an Ory Insider, please click the "Contact Us" button. Once Ory is GA,
this step will no longer be needed.

## Create your Ory Insider Project

If you have supplied an invite code, you will be greeted with the project
creation screen.

The Identity Model is a JSON Schema which describes your identity's (e.g. your
customers / users / ...) fields. In Ory, every identity can have their own
model, allowing you to separate between different customer types, user types
(e.g. employees and customers).

[Learn more about the Identity Model](concepts/identity.mdx) and the available
profiles! For the quickstart, we will use the "Demo Profile" model.

:::note

The "Demo Profile" is a preset for technical demonstrations. Do not use it in
real applications as we will eventually change or delete this profile.

:::

For demo applications, we recommend enabling sign in after registration.

:::note

Enable sign in after registration disables account enumeration defenses!

Next, hit "create" and fill out the details on the check out page. Your project
should come alive shortly after!

## Create Personal Access Token

Personal Access Tokens are bound to a project. They are needed to access
administrative APIs (e.g. deleting an identity, using the Ory CLI, ...).

:::note

Personal Access Tokens are an interim security mechanism. In the future, more
secure mechanisms such as JWT Assertions and mTLS will be supported.

:::

Head over to the "Personal Access Token" page

![Personal Access Token list](./images/get-started/pat-list.png)

and click on the plus symbol to create a new token.

![CreatePersonal Access Token](./images/get-started/pat-create.png)

Once created, a dialog will appear on the bottom left containing your personal
access token. Copy this into a password manager or another safe place. The token
will never be displayed again! If you forget it, you will need to create a new
token.
