### Get Started with Ory Cloud

As we are building Ory Cloud as the most convenient way to run Ory for
developers, user feedback and constructive exchange with the community is most
important to us. Production systems are running on Ory Cloud, and we hope we can
count you among those early adopters.

We also want to give back to our open source community and let them experience
the vision we have for Ory Cloud firsthand. It will make clear that a commercial
Ory service will help our open source ecosystem grow and thrive, not work
against it.
