title: Social Sign In `redirect_uri_mismatch` error (OTA-092022-01)
sidebar_label: Resolve redirect_uri_mismatch error
---

The problem affects Ory Cloud Projects created before September 2022 which had a custom domain enabled. When creating a new social
sign in connection, the social sign-in flow can fail with the following error message:

```text
Unable to complete OpenID Connect flow because the OpenID Provider returned error "redirect_uri_mismatch": The redirect_uri MUST match the registered callback URL for this application.
```

## Mitigation

To resolve this issue, remove the `/selfservice/methods/oidc/config/base_redirect_uri` config entry using the following Ory CLI
command:

```shell
ory patch identity-config <your-project-id> \
  --remove '/selfservice/methods/oidc/config/base_redirect_uri'
```

Please be aware that existing Social Sign In connections might break. To resolve this issue, go to your project's
[Social Sign In configuration screen](https://console.ory.sh/projects/current/social-signin) and update the Callback URL of the
failing Social Sign In provider. The Redirect URL should match.
