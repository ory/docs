The Ory Keto SDK allows for integration with a self-hosted [Ory Keto Permission Server](https://github.com/ory/keto).

Before using the SDK, consult the Ory Keto [REST](../reference/rest-api.mdx) and [gRPC](../reference/rest-api.mdx) API
documentationâ€².

To view the source code for the generated SDKs, visit the
[Ory Keto SDKs GitHub repository](https://github.com/ory/sdk/tree/master/clients/keto/). Ory SDKs are generated using the
[openapi-generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator).

### SDK backward compatibility

The Ory SDK uses automated code generation by [`openapi-generator`](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator).
`openapi-generator` can make changes to the generated code with each new version, which breaks backwards compatibility in some
cases. As a result, Ory SDK may not be compatible with previous versions.
