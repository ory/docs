# Relationships

```mdx-code-block
import Mermaid from "@site/src/theme/Mermaid"
```

Relationships are the underlying datatype of Ory Permissions. They encode relations between [objects](./10_objects.mdx), which are
the resources that you want to manage to, and [subjects](./15_subjects.mdx), which are the people or things that want to access
these resources. A relationship is associated with a [namespace](./05_namespaces.mdx) where its relation has to be defined and
configured.

You can think of relationships as edges in a graph. For a simple relationship:

```keto-relationships
User:user1 is in members of Group:group1
User:user2 is in readers of Document:readme.txt
Folder:src is in parents of Document:package.json
```

:::info

The [Zanzibar paper](https://research.google/pubs/pub48190/) uses the following notation for relationships:

```keto-relation-tuples
Group:group1#members@User:user1
```

Ory commonly uses the notation presented in the example as it's easier to read and understand.

The graphical representation looks like this:

```mdx-code-block
<Mermaid
  chart={`
graph LR
    User:user1 -->|members| Group:group1
    User:user2 -->|readers| Document:readme.txt
    Folder:src -->|members| Document:package.json
`}
/>
```

`User` and `Group` are the subject and object namespaces respectively. `user1` and `group1` are the subject and object.

## Relationships and permissions

Ory Permissions checks permissions based on:

- relationships
- permission rules

Think of relationships as of facts used to answer permission checks. When a user is added to a group, add a relationship from the
user (subject) to the group (object) through a `members` relationship. Use the permission model to define concrete permissions the
user gets by being a member of this group.
