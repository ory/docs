title: Objects
---

Objects are identifiers for some kind of application objects. They can represent for example a file, network port, physical item,
... . It's up to the application to map its objects to an unambiguous identifier. The limit on object identifiers is 64
characters. We recommend the usage of UUIDs as they provide a high entropy and thus unique identifiers. It's however possible to
use for example URLs or opaque tokens of any kind. Please check the
[limitations](#advanced-example-using-application-information-within-keto-objects). Ory Keto will consider objects equal iff their
string representation is equal.

## Basic example

In the basic case an application uses the same object identifiers as it uses internally, for example a UUIDv4 like
`61e75133-efff-4281-8148-a1806919f568` or SHA-1 hash like `5c6f593a4e12970d647843f97846fd5ed18179eb`.

Head over to the [basic full feature example](../examples/olymp-file-sharing.mdx) to see an example with some context.

## Advanced example: using application information within Keto objects

Because the Keto client can use arbitrary strings as objects, it's tempting to encode application data within the object. **We
strongly discourage this practice.** Instead, you should use a UUID to map application data to Keto objects. This is required to
ensure:

1. single source of truth and easy data update
2. free choice of encoding (Keto doesn't allow the characters `:#@`)
3. unlimited data size

For example, this could be used to implement checks on value ranges. The application knows the following mapping of comparison
conditions and UUIDs:

```yml
f832e1e7-3c97-4cb8-8582-979e63ae2f1d:
  greater_than: 5

c4540cf5-6ac4-4007-910b-c5a56aa3d4e6:
  greater_than: 2
  smaller_equal: 5
```

Keto has the following relationships:

```keto-relation-tuples
// Members of the admins group are allowed to set a value v > 5
values:f832e1e7-3c97-4cb8-8582-979e63ae2f1d#set_value@(groups:admins#member)

// Members of the devs group are allowed to set a value v: 2 < v <= 5
values:c4540cf5-6ac4-4007-910b-c5a56aa3d4e6#set_value@(groups:devs#member)

// Anyone who can set a value v > 5 can also set 2 < v <= 5
values:c4540cf5-6ac4-4007-910b-c5a56aa3d4e6#set_value@(values:f832e1e7-3c97-4cb8-8582-979e63ae2f1d#set_value)
```

The application will have to translate an incoming "set value" request to the corresponding condition the value fulfills. It's
important to understand that Ory Keto does **not** know how to interpret any of the information. Rather, the application has to
preprocess and map the value to the corresponding UUID.
