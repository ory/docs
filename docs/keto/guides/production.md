## Database

Ory Keto requires a production-grade database such as PostgreSQL, MySQL,
CockroachDB. Don't use SQLite in production!

### Write API

Never expose the Ory Keto Write API to the internet unsecured. Always require
authorization. A good practice is to not expose the Write API at all to the
public internet and use a Zero Trust Networking Architecture within your
intranet.

## Scaling

There are no additional requirements for scaling Ory Keto, just spin up another
container!
