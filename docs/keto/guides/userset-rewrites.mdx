This guide explains how to configure namespaces and relations using the
[Ory Permission Language](../reference/ory-permission-language).

The example describes a file store. Individual files are organized in a folder hierarchy, and can be accessed by individual users
or groups of users. Using the Ory Permission Language you can specify that if a user has access to a folder, the user also has
access to all files in that folder.

## Setup and Configuration

First, [install Keto](../install.mdx). Next, create a `keto.yaml` file with this basic content:

<CodeFromRemote src={file("keto.yaml")} title="keto.yaml" />

In the `namespaces` key, you see the line `config: file://./namespaces.keto.ts`. This needs to point to your namespace
configuration in the Ory Permission Language.

:::info

Namespace configurations without the Ory Permission Language are still supported by either specifying the namespaces directly or a
"naked" URI, e.g. `namespaces: file://.namespaces.yaml`.

:::

Next, create a file with the namespace configuration:

<CodeFromRemote src={file("namespaces.keto.ts")} title="namespaces.keto.ts" />

:::tip

If you are using a text editor with TypeScript support, you can get extra help when using the Ory Permission Language. Make sure
to run `npm i @ory/keto-namespaces-types` and add a `tsconfig.json` file with the content:

<CodeFromRemote src={file("tsconfig.json")} title="tsconfig.json" />

:::

### Starting Ory Keto

After you created both configuration files (`keto.yaml` and `namespaces.keto.ts`), run this command to start Ory Keto:

```sh
$ keto serve --config ./path/to/keto.yaml
```

## Creating the tuples

Now that Ory Keto is running, create relation tuples using the Keto CLI.

The following relation tuples showcase the namespace configuration. In short, it sets up a "developer" group with two members, and
a folder hierarchy. Through the rules in the Ory Permission Language, every member of the "developer" group can access the files
in the hierarchy.

You can create additional fine-grained permission rules for certain objects, similar to the "private" file.

<CodeFromRemote src={file("relation-tuples/tuples.json")} title="tuples.json" />

To load the file into Ory Keto, run this command:

```sh
$ keto relation-tuple create tuples.json

NAMESPACE       OBJECT                  RELATION NAME   SUBJECT
Group           developer               members         patrik
Group           developer               members         User:Patrik
Group           developer               members         User:Henning
Folder          keto/                   viewers         Group:developer#members
File            keto/README.md          parents         Folder:keto/
Folder          keto/src/               parents         Folder:keto/
File            keto/src/main.go        parents         Folder:keto/src/
File            private                 owners          User:Henning
```

## Checking for permissions

Now, let's check some permissions! Some queries to try:

### Transitive permissions for objects in the hierarchy

Patrik can view `keto/src/main.go`. This file is in the `keto/src` folder, which is in `keto`. The `keto` directory has the
"developer" group as its "viewers". Patrik is a member of the "developer" group.

```
$ keto check User:Patrik view File keto/src/main.go
Allowed
```

### No transitivity for objects outside the hierarchy

Patrik cannot view the private file, since that file is not part of any folder hierarchy Patrik has access to.

```
$ keto check User:Patrik view File private
Denied
```

### Fine-grained permissions for any object

Henning can both edit and view the private file, since he is an "owner" of it.

```
$ keto check User:Henning view File private
Allowed

$ keto check User:Henning edit File private
Allowed
```
