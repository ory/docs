import CodeTabs from "@site/src/theme/CodeTabs"

In this guide you will learn how to use Ory Keto's list API to display a list of all objects (for example files, ...) a user has
access to. Please refer to the [gRPC](../reference/proto-api.mdx) and [REST](../reference/rest-api.mdx) API reference
documentation for all details. The list API allows you to query relationships based on partial relationships.

## Example

As an example, we want to look at a chat application. Every user is part of one or more chats, and each chat has one or more
members.

Chats are stored in Ory Keto within the `chats` namespace. They're identified by a UUID that the application maps to the actual
object metadata. Users are also identified by and mapped to a UUID.

:::info

For the sake of readability, the code samples use the name of the chat and username instead of the UUIDs. Please refer to the
[objects](../concepts/10_objects.mdx) and [subjects](../concepts/15_subjects.mdx) pages for why the mapping is necessary.

:::

### Listing objects

Our example application allows users to browse the chats they belong to. To achieve that, it uses Ory Keto's list API.

We assume that the application has the following chats:

```yml
memes:
  members:
    - PM
    - Vincent
    - Julia
cars:
  members:
    - PM
    - Julia
coffee-break:
  members:
    - PM
    - Vincent
    - Julia
    - Patrik
```

This is represented in Ory Keto by the following [OPL Namespace configuration](../index.mdx#ory-permission-language):

```ts
class User implements Namespace {}

class Chat implements Namespace {
  related: {
    member: User[]
  }
}
```

and with the following [relationships](../concepts/01_relation-tuples.mdx):

```keto-tuples
Chat:memes#member@User:PM
Chat:memes#member@User:Vincent
Chat:memes#member@User:Julia

Chat:cars#member@User:PM
Chat:cars#member@User:Julia

Chat:coffee-break#member@User:PM
Chat:coffee-break#member@User:Vincent
Chat:coffee-break#member@User:Julia
Chat:coffee-break#member@User:Patrik
```

The user `PM` now opens the chat application. To display a list of all of `PM`'s chats, the application uses Keto's list API.

:::note

You must use the flag `--insecure-disable-transport-security` with version v0.9.0 or newer of the Keto CLI if you run Keto without
TLS.

:::

<CodeTabs sampleId="list-api-display-objects-subjectset/01-list-PM" version="master" />

As a response, the application gets the list of all chats the user `PM` is a member of. It can then use the information to build
the UI.

### Listing subjects

Another view of the chat application has to display all members of a specific group to the user. This can also be achieved using
the list API. In cases where such a membership would be modeled through [subject sets](../concepts/15_subjects.mdx#subject-sets),
you have to use the [expand-API](./expand-api-display-who-has-access.mdx).

:::caution

In this case the application should probably first use the [check-API](./simple-access-check-guide.mdx) to check whether the user
is allowed to list the members of a group. This step isn't part of this example.

:::

In our example, a user wants to see who is a member of the `coffee-break` group:

<CodeTabs sampleId="list-api-display-objects-subjectset/02-list-coffee-break" version="master" />

## Application context

It's important to note that the list API does **not** expand [subject sets](../concepts/15_subjects.mdx#subject-sets). Usually the
application has some context to determine what tuples to query anyway. That could be knowledge of the structure of subject sets
like depth or hierarchy, or the UI context, like a "My Items" view which should probably contain other objects than a "My
Organizations" or "Shared with Me" views. If there really is no way to narrow down a query, you will have to use the
[expand-API](./expand-api-display-who-has-access) instead, or repeatedly call the list API. Try to avoid such cases because they
require a lot of resources and can quickly degrade the service quality for all users.

## Pagination

The list API only returns paginated results. It isn't possible to customize the order of results. The response returns an opaque
token that has to be used to retrieve the following page. The first page can be retrieved by passing no, or an empty token.

The page size can be adjusted at any point, not only when requesting the first page. It defaults to 100 items.
