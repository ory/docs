import CodeTabs from "@site/src/theme/CodeTabs"

This guide will explain how to use Ory Keto's expand-API to display who has access to an object, and why. Please refer to the
[gRPC](../reference/proto-api.mdx) and [REST](../reference/rest-api.mdx) API reference documentation for all details. The
expand-API allows to expand a given subject set into all its effective subjects.

## Example

As an example, we want to look at a file sharing application. Files are hierarchically organized in a directory structure. Every
user owns files and directories, and can grant any other user access to them on a per-file or per-directory basis. Users can only
see and access files they own or were granted access by the owner.

Directories and files are stored in Ory Keto within the `directories` and `files` namespaces respectively. They're identified by a
UUID that the application maps to the actual object metadata. Users are also identified by and mapped to a UUID.

:::info

For the sake of readability, the code samples use the object path and user name instead. Please refer to the
[objects](../concepts/10_objects.mdx) and [subjects](../concepts/15_subjects.mdx) pages for why the mapping is necessary.

### Displaying who has access

To assist users with managing permissions for their files, the application has to display who has access to a file and why. In
this example, we assume that the application knows the following files and directories:

```
├─ photos            (owner: Alice; shared with Bob)
   ├─ beach.jpg      (owner: Alice)
   ├─ mountains.jpg  (owner: Bob)
```

This is represented in Ory Keto by the following [relationships](../concepts/01_relation-tuples.mdx):

```keto-tuples
// ownership
directories:/photos#owner@Alice
files:/photos/beach.jpg#owner@Alice
files:/photos/mountains.jpg#owner@Bob

// Alice granted access to /photos to Bob
directories:/photos#access@Bob

// the following tuples are defined implicitly through subject set rewrites (not supported yet)
directories:/photos#access@(directories:/photos#owner)
files:/photos/beach.jpg#access@(files:/photos/beach.jpg#owner)
files:/photos/beach.jpg#access@(directories:/photos#access)
files:/photos/mountains.jpg#access@(files:/photos/mountains.jpg#owner)
files:/photos/mountains.jpg#access@(directories:/photos#access)

// the following tuples are required to allow the subject set rewrites (not supported yet)
directories:/photos#parent@(files:/photos/beach.jpg#_)
directories:/photos#parent@(files:/photos/mountains.jpg#_)
```

The user `Alice` now wants to manage `access` for the file `/photos/beach.jpg`. Therefore, the application uses the expand-API to
get a tree of everyone who has access to that file.

:::note

You must use the flag `--insecure-disable-transport-security` with version v0.9.0 or newer of the Keto CLI if you run Keto without
TLS.

### Maximum tree depth

The `max-depth` parameter is important to keep the request latency within an acceptable bound, but also abstract away the most
basic subject sets. In many cases the application doesn't want to resolve all subject sets, but rather wants to display that for
example `Everyone in the company` or `Admins` have a specific relation.

In this example the application knows the rough structure of the relationships it uses and can therefore determine that
`max-depth=3` is sufficient to display all relevant relations:

1. directly granted access (depth 1)
2. indirectly granted access through ownership (depth 2)
3. indirectly granted access through ownership of the parent (depth 3)

### Analyzing the tree

The tree doesn't only include the subject IDs (in this case usernames), but also for what reason they were included. This can be
useful for users to audits permissions. Also, in many cases the application would not want to list all subject IDs but rather
abstract away some subject sets.
