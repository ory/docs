# Introduction

Ory Permissions is a modern permission system you can use to create a complete authorization system for your application or
website, no matter the size or the complexity of the ACLs (access-control lists) your use case requires. Ory Permissions, based on
the open-source Ory Keto Permission Server, is the first open-source implementation of the design principles and specifications
described in [Zanzibar: Google's Consistent, Global Authorization System](https://research.google/pubs/pub48190/).

Implementing the design principles described in the Zanzibar paper allows Ory Permissions to offer the following benefits over
other, widely adopted permission systems:

- Flexibility: Traditional permission systems typically rely on a fixed set of permissions and access control rules that are
  difficult to customize or modify. Ory Permissions provides a flexible data model you can customize to fit a wide range of use
  cases. Creating custom permission models is aided by Ory Permission Language, a developer-friendly, TypeScript-based
  configuration language.

- Scalability: While traditional permission systems often struggle to handle large-scale applications and services with high
  request volume, Ory Permissions is designed to be highly scalable and handle a large number of concurrent requests without
  sacrificing performance or reliability.

With Ory Permissions, you can:

- Use Ory Permission Language to create permission models that fit your exact use case - RBAC, ABAC, and beyond.
- Unify authorization logic in one service that's the single source of truth for access rights across all of your applications.
- Be tech-stack agnostic and use Ory Network [SDKs](./sdk/01_overview.md) available for all major programming languages.
- Issue fine-grained permissions, for example `User:x is in readers of Document:y`.
- Allow permissions inheritance through groups, roles, and hierarchies to ensure organic scaling that follows the growth of your
  application.

## Ory Permission Language

The Ory Permission Language (OPL) is a developer-friendly configuration language defined as a subset of
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). It's designed to be easy to learn and has a familiar source in contrary to other,
proprietary languages used to represent permissions, such as Rego or Casbin.

:::tip

You can create permission rules with OPL using the Ory Console. Go to [**Ory Console**](https://console.ory.sh/) â†’ **Namespaces &
Rules** and use the editor in the **Permission Rules** tab.

:::

This is an example of OPL code:

```ts
import { Namespace, Context } from "@ory/keto-namespace-types"

class User implements Namespace {}

class Document implements Namespace {
  // All relationships for a single document.
  related: {
    editors: User[]
    viewers: User[]
  }

  // The permissions derived from the relationships and context.
  permits = {
    // A permission is a function that takes the context and returns a boolean. It can reference `this.related` and `this.permits`.
    write: (ctx: Context): boolean => this.related.editors.includes(ctx.subject),
    read: (ctx: Context): boolean => this.permits.write(ctx) || this.related.viewers.includes(ctx.subject),
  }
}
```
