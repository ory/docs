## A basic, down-to-earth full feature example

Consider a file sharing application called "Olymp Library". Each file is stored in a key-value store, where the key is a UUIDv4
(pseudorandom unique identifier), while the value is the metadata and content. The application uses Ory Keto to keep track of
ownership and granted access on a per file level.

:::note

This example assumes there is a [namespace](../concepts/05_namespaces.mdx) `files` with the relations `owner` and `access`
defined, where each `owner` of an object also has `access` to that object. All relationships are stored in that namespace.

:::

Now, the user identified by its unique username `demeter` wants to upload a file containing the most fertile grounds. The file
gets assigned the UUID `ec788a82-a12e-45a4-b906-3e69f78c94e4`. The application adds the following
[relationship](../concepts/01_relation-tuples.mdx) to Ory Keto through the
[write-API](../concepts/25_api-overview.mdx#write-apis):

```keto-relation-tuples
ec788a82-a12e-45a4-b906-3e69f78c94e4#owner@demeter
```

To prepare for an important meeting with the user `athena`, `demeter` wants to share the file with fertile grounds with `athena`
so that they can both read it. Therefore, he opens the "Olymp Library" and is presented with a list of all files he owns. The
application will internally request all [objects](../concepts/10_objects.mdx) (file IDs) with the owner `demeter` by using the
[list-API](../concepts/25_api-overview.mdx#list-relationships). The response will contain the object
`ec788a82-a12e-45a4-b906-3e69f78c94e4`, which the application maps to the file in question.

The user `demeter` will then ask the application to share the file with `athena`. The application will translate that request into
a [write-API request](../concepts/25_api-overview.mdx#write-apis) adding the following relationship to Ory Keto:

```keto-relation-tuples
ec788a82-a12e-45a4-b906-3e69f78c94e4#access@athena
```

To confirm the successful operation, the application uses Ory Keto's
[expand-API](../concepts/25_api-overview.mdx#expand-subject-sets) to compile a list of everyone who can access the file:

```keto-relation-tuples
// The following subject set is expanded by Keto
ec788a82-a12e-45a4-b906-3e69f78c94e4#access
```

which returns the expansion tree

```
∪ ec788a82-a12e-45a4-b906-3e69f78c94e4#access
├─ ∪ ec788a82-a12e-45a4-b906-3e69f78c94e4#owner
│  ├─ ☘ demeter
├─ ☘ athena
```

The "Olymp Library" can then display this information to `demeter`.

When `athena` wants to get the file containing fertile grounds, the application uses the
[check-API](../concepts/25_api-overview.mdx#check-relationships) to verify that `athena` has access to the file before it returns
the file. This will allow `demeter` to revoke `athena`'s access at any point by deleting the corresponding relationship.

This diagram illustrates the relationships in this example:
