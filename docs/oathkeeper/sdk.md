:::

### SDK Backwards compatibility

The Ory SDK uses automated code generation by [`openapi-generator`](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator).
`openapi-generator` can make changes to the generated code with each new version, which breaks backwards compatibility in some
cases. As a result, the Ory SDK may not be compatible with previous versions.
