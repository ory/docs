Follow this guide when upgrading Ory Oathkeeper to a newer version.

Ory Oathkeeper does not store state in a database, so you do not need to backup data when upgrading.

1. Review breaking changes.  
   Visit the [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) to see if breaking changes have been
   introduced in the version you are upgrading to.
1. [Install](../install.md) the new version of Ory Oathkeeper.
1. Restart Ory Oathkeeper.
1. You're done!

Should you run into problems with the upgrade, please visit the community [chat](https://slack.ory.sh/) or start a
[discussion](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/discussions).
