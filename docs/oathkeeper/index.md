Welcome to the ORY Oathkeeper documentation!

ORY Oathkeeper is a reverse proxy which evaluates incoming HTTP requests based on a set of rules (called "access rules").
The feature set ORY Oathkeeper implements is referred to as an Identity and Access Proxy (IAP) in the context
of [BeyondCorp and ZeroTrust](https://www.beyondcorp.com).

In principal, ORY Oathkeeper inspects the `Authorization` header and the full request url (e.g. `https://mydomain.com/api/foo`)
of incoming HTTP requests, applies a set of rules, and either grants access to the requested url or denies access.
