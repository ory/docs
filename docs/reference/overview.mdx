## Ory CLI

The Ory CLI is the primary interface for managing Ory from the command line. Use it to create and configure projects, 
manage identities and permissions, run local development environments with built-in tunneling, and move configurations 
between self-hosted and Ory Network deployments.

## Rest APIs

Ory's REST APIs let you manage identities, OAuth2 clients, permissions, and project configuration programmatically. 
Public APIs handle end-user flows like authentication. Administrative APIs require a Personal Access Token and cover 
backend operations. SDKs are available for supported languages.

## Ory SDKs

Ory provides two SDK families depending on your deployment. The Ory Network SDK is a single, unified client that covers 
identity management, OAuth2, and permissions in one package. Service-specific SDKs are available for self-hosted 
deployments, with a separate client for each Ory product.

### Ory Network SDK

A unified client (ory_client) for integrating with Ory Network. It covers identities, OAuth2, and permissions in a 
single package, targeting your project's API at `https://{project_slug}.projects.oryapis.com/`. Available in multiple 
languages. Consult the REST API documentation for code samples and usage examples.

### Service‑specific SDKs for self‑hosted deployments

Each SDK is documented under its respective product reference. These are intended for self-hosted deployments only. You
must use the unified Ory Network SDK for Ory Network integrations.

Separate clients for each self-hosted Ory product:

- [Ory Hydra](/hydra/sdk/overview)
- [Ory Keto](/keto/sdk/overview)
