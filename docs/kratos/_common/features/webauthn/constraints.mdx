There are some limitations to WebAuthN to be considered in development:

- WebAuthN is a Browser standard. It does not work on native mobile apps.
- WebAuthN is limited to one domain and does not work in a local environment when using CNAME / Ory Proxy. WebAuthN uses an
  `https://origin` URL as part of the client<->server challenge/response mechanism. This mechanism allows for only one URL as the
  origin. Read more in the [WebAuthN guide](https://webauthn.guide/) and on [GitHub](https://github.com/w3c/webauthn/issues/1372).
- Implementing WebAuthN in your own UI can be challenging, depending on which framework to use. Please check our
  [reference implementations](../../../kratos/guides/custom-ui.mdx) to see how we solved it for different app types (web, single
  page app).
