title: Feature Deprecations
sidebar_label: Feature Deprecations
---

This section lists all behavior that has been deprecated in Ory Kratos. It is recommended to check this section regularly to stay
up-to-date with the latest changes and to avoid relying on deprecated functionality in your implementation. While Ory Kratos is
designed to be backward compatible, some improvements require changes to the underlying implementation, which may lead to the
deprecation of certain functionality.

Ory is committed to maintaining a high level of quality and performance in our products, and deprecating features is a rare but
necessary step to ensure that we can continue to innovate and improve our offerings. We understand that deprecations can be
disruptive, and we strive to provide clear communication and ample time for users to adapt to changes. We encourage users to
review the deprecation information provided in this section and to reach out to our support channels if they have any questions or
concerns about the deprecation of features in any Ory product.

## Who does this apply to?

Users of the Ory Network, Ory Kratos (open source) and the OEL (Ory Enterprise License) are affected by this section.

## How to use this section

Each entry in this section provides information about the deprecated feature, including:

- A brief description of the feature and its purpose.
- The reason for deprecation, if available.
- The version in which the feature was deprecated.
- Any recommended alternatives or migration paths, if applicable.

If you're using an Ory Network project, your configuration will not change, unless you have explicitly disabled the deprecated
feature via a project level feature flag. To check which flags are currently enabled, go to
<ConsoleLink route="project.settings.advanced" />.

If you're self-hosting Ory Kratos (either through open source or the OEL), you should review your configuration and codebase to
identify any usage of deprecated features before upgrading to a new version. This will help you avoid any potential issues that
may arise from the removal of deprecated features in future releases.

## Staying Informed

Subscribe to the [Ory Changelog](https://changelog.ory.com) to receive updates on new releases, including information about
deprecated features and their removal timelines. Additionally, consider joining the Ory community on Slack or GitHub to stay
engaged with other users and developers, and to get support for any questions or issues related to deprecated features.

## Impacted functionality

### Admin session extension API (`faster_session_extend`)

**Who is impacted by this change?**

This improvement may impact users who are using the `/admin/sessions/{id}/extend` endpoint ([`extendSession`](../reference/api#tag/identity/operation/extendSession) SDK operation) to
extend their users' sessions. The new implementation may result in faster response times and improved performance when extending
sessions.

**Why was this change made?**

The change was made to improve the performance and efficiency of the session extension process. By decoupling the session
extension from the retrieval of the updated session information, we can reduce the processing time and resource usage for
extending sessions, especially in scenarios with high traffic or large session data.

**How to adapt to this change?**

If your application is using the updated session returned by the `/admin/sessions/{id}/extend` endpoint after the session
extension, you will need to update your implementation to retrieve the updated session information separately, using the
`/admin/sessions/{id}` endpoint ([`getSession`](../reference/api#tag/identity/operation/getSession) SDK operation) after the session extension.

After you reviewed your usage of this API, follow the instructions below based on your deployment type to ensure that you are
benefiting from the improved session extension process.

    Go to <ConsoleLink route="project.settings.advanced" hash="kratos_feature_flags_faster_session_extend" /> and enable the
    "Faster session extension" feature flag to benefit from this improvement.

    Starting with [Ory Kratos v1.3.0](https://github.com/ory/kratos/releases/tag/v1.3.0), the faster session extension process is
    enabled by default. If you need to disable this feature for any reason, you can set the `feature_flags.faster_session_extend`
    configuration option to `false` in your Kratos configuration file.
