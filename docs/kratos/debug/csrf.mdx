For general CRSF troubleshooting visit the [Ory Identities documentation](../../troubleshooting/10_crsf.mdx).

This document contains troubleshooting advice regarding CRSF and cookie errors specific to self-hosted Ory Identities Kratos.

## Common issues

### SameSite attribute

If you run Ory Kratos in `--dev` mode, it disables `SameSite=Lax` as Google Chrome rejects all cookies that have `SameSite=Lax`
but have `secure` set to `false`. If you require `SameSite=Lax`, you need to run Ory Kratos with HTTPS and not use the `--dev`
flag.

### Running over HTTP without `--dev` mode

Ory Kratos' cookies have the `Secure` flag enabled by default. This means that the browser won't send the cookie unless the URL is
a HTTPS URL. If you want Ory Kratos to work with HTTP (for example on localhost) you can add the `--dev` flag:
`kratos serve --dev`.

**Don't do this in production!**

### Running on separate (sub)domains

Cookies work best on the same domain. While it's possible to get cookies running on subdomains it isn't possible to do that across
Top Level Domains (TLDs).

Make sure that your application (for example the Quickstart self service app ) and Ory Kratos Public API are available on the same
domain - preferably without subdomains. Hosting both systems and routing paths with a Reverse Proxy such as Nginx or Envoy or AWS
API Gateway is the best solution. For example, routing `https://my-website/kratos/...` to Ory Kratos and
`https://my-website/dashboard` to the SecureApp's Dashboard. Alternatively you can use piping in your app as we do in the
Quickstart guide.

We don't recommend running them on separate subdomains, such as `https://kratos.my-website/` and `https://secureapp.my-website/`.

To allow cookies to work across subdomains, make sure to set the domain name in the Kratos config file under
[`session.cookie.domain`](https://www.ory.sh/kratos/docs/next/guides/configuring-cookies/#session-cookies).

Running the apps on different domains won't work at all, such as `https://kratos-my-website/` and `https://secureapp-my-website/`.

Running the services on different ports is ok, if the domain stays the same.

### Mixing up 127.0.0.1 and localhost

Make sure that the domain stays the same. This is also true for `127.0.0.1` and `localhost` which are both separate domains. Make
sure that you use `127.0.0.1` or `localhost` consistently across your configuration!
