Self-Service flows such as Login, Registration, Updating Settings support two successful response modes:

- For browsers, the response will be a [redirection](#redirection).
- For API clients (this includes AJAX) the response will be in [JSON](#json).

## Redirection

Browser requests, identified by the `Accept: text/html` header, complete with a redirection flow. If no redirection URL is set for
the flow, the Default Redirect URL will be used for most flows (for example login, registration):

```yaml file="config.yml"
selfservice:
  default_browser_return_url: https://always-end-up-here-per-default/
```

It's possible to specify a redirect URL per Self-Service Flow:

```yaml file="config.yml"
selfservice:
  flows:
    login:
      after:
        default_browser_return_url: https://end-up-here-after-login/
    registration:
      after:
        default_browser_return_url: https://end-up-here-after-registration/
    # verification
    # ...
```

You may also set redirect URLs per method (overrides `selfservice.flows.<login|registration|...>.default_return_to`):

```yaml file="config.yml"
selfservice:
  flows:
    login:
      after:
        default_browser_return_url: https://this-is-overridden-by-password/
        password:
          default_browser_return_url: https://end-up-here-after-login-with-password/
      # ...
```

It's also possible to redirect someone back to the original URL. For example, if a user requests
`https://www.myapp.com/blog/write` but isn't logged in, we want the user to end up at that page after login. To achieve that, you
append `?return_to=https://www.myapp.com/blog/write` when initializing the Login / Registration /Settings flow.

Because Ory Identities prevents Open Redirect Attacks, you need to whitelist the domain in your Ory Identities config when using
the `?return_to=` query parameter. For other return urls specified inside the configuration it isn't necessary to add the domain
to the whitelist.

Let's look at an example, here we're adding `myapp.com` to the whitelist, thus we can now specify a dynamic return url like so
`?return_to=https://www.myapp.com/blog/write`.

```yaml file="config.yml"
selfservice:
  allowed_return_urls:
    - https://www.myapp.com/
```

### Post-login redirection

Post-login redirection considers the following configuration keys:

```yaml file="config.yml"
selfservice:
  default_browser_return_url: https://end-up-here-per-default/
  flows:
    login:
      after:
        # overrides url.default_browser_return_url
        default_browser_return_url: https://this-is-overridden-by-password/
        password:
          # overrides selfservice.login.after.default_browser_return_url
          default_browser_return_url: https://end-up-here-after-login-with-password/
```

### Post-registration redirection

Post-registration redirection considers the following configuration keys:

```yaml file="config.yml"
selfservice:
  default_browser_return_url: https://end-up-here-per-default/
  flows:
    registration:
      after:
        # overrides url.default_browser_return_url
        default_browser_return_url: https://this-is-overridden-by-password/
        password:
          # overrides selfservice.registration.after.default_browser_return_url
          default_browser_return_url: https://end-up-here-after-registration-with-password/
```

### Post-settings redirection

Post-settings redirection **doesn't use** the `urls.default_redirect_to` configuration key. Instead the redirect ends at the same
Settings UI with the same Settings Request ID and key `state` set to `success`. If the listed keys are set, the redirection will
end up at the specified values:

```yaml file="config.yml"
selfservice:
  flows:
    settings:
      after:
        default_redirect_to: https://this-is-overridden-by-password/
        password:
          # overrides selfservice.settings.after.default_redirect_to
          default_redirect_to: https://end-up-here-after-settings-with-password/
```

### Post-verification redirection

Post-verification redirection **doesn't use** the `urls.default_redirect_to` configuration key. Instead the redirect ends at the
same Verification UI with the same Verification Request ID and key `state` set to `passed_challenge`. If the listed keys are set,
the redirection will end up at the specified values:

```yaml file="config.yml"
selfservice:
  flows:
    verification:
      after:
        default_redirect_to: https://this-is-overridden-by-password/
```

#### Specify redirection URL during registration

Verification emails are usually sent in response to a successful registration flow. To specify the redirect URL for the
verification flow after registration, append `after_verification_return_to` to the Browser Registration Init endpoint:

```
https://public.url/self-service/registration/browser?after_verification_return_to=https://my-redirect/foo
```

## JSON

Requests from API clients - for example AJAX - are identified by the `Accept: application/json` header and return a JSON response.
If no redirection URL is set for the flow, the `default_redirect_to` URL will be used for most flows.
