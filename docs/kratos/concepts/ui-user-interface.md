title: User Interface

ORY Kratos has no user interface included. Instead, it defines HTTP flows and APIs that make it simple to
write your own UI in a variety of languages and frameworks.

The following two examples are typical UIs used in connection with ORY Kratos.

## Administrative User Interface (Admin UI)

The AUI might show all of the identities in the system and provide features to
administrators such as editing profiles, resetting passwords, and so on.

At present, there is no Open Source AUI for ORY Kratos.

## Self-service User Interface (SSUI)

The SSUI shows screens such as "login", "Registration", "Update your profile",
"Recover your account", and others. The following provides more reference for SSUI at
[github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-node](https://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-node).

The SSUI can be built in any programming language including Java,
Node, or Python and can be run both a server or a end-user device for example a browser, or a mobile phone. Implementing a
SSUI is simple and straight forward. There is no complex
authentication mechanism required and no need to worry about possible
attack vectors such as CSRF or Session Attacks since ORY Kratos provides the preventive measures built in.

Chapter [Self-Service Flows](../self-service/flows/index.md) contains further information on APIs and flows related to
the SSUI, and build self service applications.
