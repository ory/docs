title: Threat models and security profiles
---

Threat modeling is essential for securing a system like Ory Identities. This document provides guidelines for identifying and
analyzing threats and implementing security measures for Ory Identities and self-hosted Ory Kratos Identity Server.

Running software that stores personal information carries risk. It is important to identify threats and understand the system's
attack surface, the likelihood, and the impact of an attack.

In the case of Ory Identities, threats could include hackers or malicious insiders who may try to steal or manipulate personal
information. To protect against these threats, it is important to properly configure Ory and implement appropriate security
measures, such as strong authentication and access controls. Regular monitoring and timely response to security incidents are also
crucial.

## Digital identity guidelines

There is no universally accepted standard for digital identity.  
Ory follows [Digital Identity Guidelines](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/) established by the
[National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)](https://www.nist.gov/).  
These guidelines are accompanied by a [FAQ](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/) that provides additional information and answers to
common questions.

## Brute-force defenses

Ory Network provides Ory Identities with protection against brute force attacks by rate-limiting requests to API public endpoints,
for example login and registration endpoints.

When self-hosting the Ory Kratos Identity Server, it is the responsibility of the administrator to implement and manage
rate-limiting or other measures to ensure the security of the network.

## Account takeover defenses

The [settings flow](../self-service/flows/user-settings) implements account takeover defenses by requiring the current password
before allowing the user to change it. This makes it impossible for an attacker to change the password without knowing the
existing password.

## Anti-automation defenses

Out-of-band communication methods, such as sending activation links via email or activation codes via SMS, are vulnerable to abuse
by automated systems. This type of attack can result in a large number of emails or SMS being sent, which could damage your
reputation or incur significant costs.

Ory Network provides Ory Identities with protection against automation attacks by rate-limiting all email-sending endpoints.

When self-hosting the Ory Kratos Identity Server, it is the responsibility of the administrator to implement rate-limiting or
CAPTCHA measures to ensure the security of the network. For guidelines on how this can be implemented for each flow please check
the [concept documentation for self-service flows](https://www.ory.sh/docs/kratos/self-service).
