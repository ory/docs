title: Threat models and security profiles

Threat modeling is essential for securing a system like Ory Identities. This document provides guidelines for identifying and
analyzing threats and implementing security measures for Ory Identities.

Working with and managing software that stores personal information carries risk. It's important to identify threats and
understand the system's attack surface, the likelihood, and the impact of an attack.

In the case of Ory Identities, threats could include hackers or malicious insiders who may try to steal or manipulate personal
information. To protect against these threats, it's important to properly configure Ory and implement appropriate security
measures, such as strong authentication and access controls. Regular monitoring and timely response to security incidents are also
crucial.

## Digital identity guidelines

There is no universally accepted standard for digital identity.  
Ory follows [Digital Identity Guidelines](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/) established by the
[National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)](https://www.nist.gov/).  
These guidelines are accompanied by a [FAQ](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/) that provides additional information and answers to
common questions.

## Defenses against brute-force attacks

Ory Network provides Ory Identities with protection against brute-force attacks by rate limiting requests to API public endpoints,
for example login and registration endpoints.

When self-hosting the Ory Kratos Identity Server, it's the responsibility of the administrator to implement and manage rate
limiting or other measures to ensure the security of the network.

## Defenses against cross-site request forgery

Cross-site request forgery, also known as CSRF or XSRF, is a type of attack that occurs when a malicious website or attacker
tricks a user's web browser into sending a request to another website without the user's knowledge or consent. In the context of
Ory Identities, it is a security vulnerability that can be exploited by an attacker to gain unauthorized access to a user's
account or perform actions on their behalf.

For example, imagine an attacker creates a website that has a form that, when submitted, sends a request to Ory Identities to
change a user's password. If a user is logged in and visits the attacker's website, their browser may automatically include their
Ory session cookie in the request, allowing the attacker to change the user's password without their knowledge or consent. To
prevent this Ory Identities uses a cookie-based security model with the [`sameSite`](samesite at w3) attribute on the cookie. This
means that the Ory session cookie can only sent with requests that originate from the same website or origin that set the cookie,
effectively protecting against cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks.

This is a security feature that allows Ory Identities to only recognize requests made by the same website, preventing a malicious
website from making a request to Ory Identities on behalf of the user. This way, even if an attacker is able to create a request
that includes a user's session cookie, the request will not be accepted by Ory Identities as it will not be made from the same
website. It ensures that only requests from the same origin are able to use the cookie, providing an additional layer of security
against CSRF attacks.
