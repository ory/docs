# Passkeys

[Passkeys](https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/) are, as described by the [FIDO Alliance](https://fidoalliance.org/), "a password
replacement that provides faster, easier, and more secure sign-ins to websites and apps across a user's devices."

Using passkeys allows for passwordless user sign-up and sign-in, which creates a safer environment for your system's users who
don't have to rely on easily exploitable, legacy authentication methods such as passwords.

Passkeys are an industry-accepted and adopted standard, which means that all of your users will be able to use this feature, no
matter the hardware they work with. The notable adopters of passkeys include:

- Apple with [Apple Passkeys](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213305)
- [Google](https://developers.google.com/identity/passkeys/supported-environments)
- [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/05/05/this-world-password-day-consider-ditching-passwords-altogether/)

While companies can add proprietary features to passkeys, such as iCloud synchronization in Apple Passkeys or Google Password
Manager synchronization for Android devices, all of them use the same FIDO standard. This means that enabling passkeys is a
simple, one-time operation in Ory.

## Choose passkey strategy

Ory Network implements a dedicated passkey strategy that improves the ergonomics over using the webauthn strategy for first-factor
login. Here is a comparison of the two approaches:

|                                                                                                                            | Webauthn passwordless login | Passkey strategy |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------- |
| **Discoverable credentials:** The browser automatically discovers which credentials the user has stored for the site.      | ❌                          | ✔︎              |
| **Conditional UI:** The browser attaches an autofill dropdown to the email field that allows the user to select a passkey. | ❌                          | ✔︎              |
| **Backwards compatibility:** Works for users that have a passkey configured with the WebAuthN strategy.                    | ✔︎                         | ❌               |

## Passkeys with the dedicated passkey strategy

### Configuration

By default, the passkey strategy is disabled. Go to <ConsoleLink route="project.passwordless" /> and toggle the switch for
**Enable Passkey authentication** to enable it.

```mdx-code-block
<BrowserWindow url="https://console.ory.sh/projects/current/passwordless">

![Passkey in Console](../_static/passkeys/console.png)

</BrowserWindow>
```

Alternatively, use the Ory CLI to enable the passkey strategy:

```mdx-code-block
import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock'
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="cli" label="Ory CLI">
    <CodeBlock language="shell">{`ory patch identity-config <your-project-id> \\
  --add '/selfservice/methods/passkey/enabled=true' \\
  --add '/selfservice/methods/passkey/config/rp/display_name="My Display Name"'
`}
    </CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="full" label="Full Config" default>
    <CodeBlock language="yaml" title="config.yml">{`selfservice:
  methods:
    passkey:
      enabled: true
      config:
        display_name: "My Display Name"`}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

### Identity schema

If you want to use a custom identity schema, you must define which field of the identity schema is the display name for the
passkey. If you do not define the `passkey.display_name` field, the `webauthn.identifier` will be used as a fallback. If neither
is defined, the passkey strategy will not work.

```json5 title="identity.schema.json" {16-18}
{
  $schema: "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  type: "object",
  properties: {
    traits: {
      type: "object",
      properties: {
        email: {
          type: "string",
          format: "email",
          title: "Your E-Mail",
          minLength: 3,
          "ory.sh/kratos": {
            credentials: {
              // ...
              passkey: {
                display_name: true,
              },
            },
            // ...
          },
        },
        // ...
      },
      // ...
    },
  },
}
```

## Passkeys with the WebAuthN strategy

### Configuration

To allow using passkeys, enable passwordless login. To do that in the Ory Network, go to

<ConsoleLink route="project.passwordless" /> and toggle the switch to enable the feature.

```mdx-code-block
import BrowserWindow from "@site/src/theme/BrowserWindow"

<BrowserWindow url="https://console.ory.sh/">

![Enabling passwordless login allows to use passkeys](../_static/webauthn/1.png)

</BrowserWindow>
```

### Example

This is a macOS Safari prompt the browser shows when users try to sign in using the passwordless method. The first option allows
to use a passkey associated with this account that's stored in the iCloud Keychain of the user that's signed in to iCloud on this
device.

The second option allows delegating user authentication to a camera-equipped device. Upon successful authentication, a matching
passkey found on the device will be used to sign in.
