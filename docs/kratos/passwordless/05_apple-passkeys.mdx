# Apple Passkeys

Apple Passkeys are a proprietary, Apple-built password replacement based on the WebAuthn standard. A unique cryptographic key pair
is generated by a device and is stored in user's iCloud Keychain, which allows to synchronize passkeys across all devices of the
user.

To enable Apple Passkeys for your users, you don't have perform any additional configuration other than enabling paswordless
login. To do that in the Ory Network, go to [**Ory Console**](https://console.ory.sh/) â†’ **Passwordless Login** and toggle the
switch to enable the feature.

```mdx-code-block
import BrowserWindow from "@site/src/theme/BrowserWindow"

<BrowserWindow url="https://console.ory.sh/">

</BrowserWindow>
```

This is a Safari prompt the browser shows when users try to sign in using the passwordless method. The first option allows to use
a passkey associated with this account that's stored in the iCloud Keyhain of the user that's signed in to iCloud on this device.

The second option allows to delegate user authentication to a camera-equipped Apple device. Upon successful authentication, a
matching passkey from the device owner's iCloud Keychain will be used to sign in.

```mdx-code-block
<BrowserWindow url="https://my.app/login">
