To set up Ory Kratos for multiple tenants, you have two options:

- [Ory Network](https://console.ory.sh) for a managed cloud service.
- [Ory Enterprise License](../../self-hosted/oel/index.mdx) for an self-hosted on-premise solution.

The Ory Kratos open-source version is intended for single-tenant use only. Its data model isn't architected to support the data
isolation, scalability, and operational needs of a multi-tenant environment.

Please reach out on the [Ory Community Chat](https://slack.ory.sh/) or via [email](https://www.ory.sh/contact) if you have any
questions on multitenancy support.
