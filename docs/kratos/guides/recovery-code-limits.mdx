title: Limits on how many times a recovery code can be submitted
---

A user can recover their account by providing an address associated with their account, for example an email address, and having the system send a code to that address. Then, the user submits this code, to prove they own the address.

It is important to find a balance between allowing a user to submit the code multiple times, due to network issues or typos, and not too many times, to prevent an attacker from brute-forcing the code.

To that end, a numeric limit can be configured with the setting `kratos_selfservice_methods_code_config_max_submissions`. The default is `5`. To prevent misconfiguration, this number is required to be between `1` and `255`. We recommend a rather small number for security reasons, probably under 10. Organisations with strict security policies might set this number to `2` or `3`.


When the code is submitted too many times (that is to say, the configured limit is reached), the recovery flow fails.
