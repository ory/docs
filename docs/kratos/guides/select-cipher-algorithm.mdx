title: Selecting Cipher Algorithm
---

Currently, the Ory Identity Service (Kratos) supports encryption and decryption for OIDC tokens only. You can choose one of these
algorithms:

## Noop

Noop is the default cipher. It doesn't use an algorithm, which means that you don't need to set secrets.

```yaml title=path/to/kratos/config.yml
ciphers:
  algorithm: noop
```

## XChaCha20 Poly1305

Apply the following configuration to use XChaCha20 Poly1305:

```yaml title=path/to/kratos/config.yml
secrets:
  cipher:
    - 32-CHARACTER-LONG-STRING-SECRET
ciphers:
  algorithm: xchacha20-poly1305
```

You must set up [secrets key rotation](secret-key-rotation). Secrets must be 32-character-long strings.

## AES

Apply the following configuration to use AES:

```yaml title=path/to/kratos/config.yml
secrets:
  cipher:
    - 32-CHARACTER-LONG-STRING-SECRET
ciphers:
  algorithm: aes
```

You must set up [secrets key rotation](secret-key-rotation). Secrets must be 32-character-long strings.
