When working with cookies, keep the following in mind:

1. HTTP Cookies **aren't port specific**. If a cookie is set on `https://mydomain.com:1234` it's also valid for
   `https://mydomain.com:4321` and `https://mydomain.com`.
2. Unless `--dev` is set, Ory Kratos' cookies are only sent over HTTPS.
3. Cookies in Ory Kratos are always `httpOnly`.
4. It's possible to set a cookie for `mydomain.com` when the original request was made to `subdomain.mydomain.com`. It's however
   not possible to set a cookie for `anotherdomain.com` when the original request was made to `mydomain.com`. See also
   [this answer on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18492576/share-cookie-between-subdomain-and-domain).

:::note

Ory Kratos uses pass-by-value cookies whose values are encrypted using the `secrets.default` / `secrets.cookie` secrets. If these
secrets are changed without doing proper [secret / key rotation](secret-key-rotation), all cookies will be invalid which will
cause users to be signed out, and other side effects.

## Session cookies

CloudRun, Heroku, and other "serverless" solutions commonly expose services directly to the public, and don't allow for fronting
by a gateway or reverse proxy. In those cases, your application architecture may separate services by subdomain (for example
`service1.myproduct.com`, `service2.myproduct.com`, `service3.myproduct.com`, ...).

If that's the case you can change the session [cookie domain](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies) and path
using the following configuration keys in your Ory Kratos configuration:

```yaml title="path/to/kratos/config.yml
session:
  cookie:
    domain: myproduct.com
```

It's also possible to restrict the [cookie path](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies):

:::note

It's very unlikely that you need to change this!

:::

```yaml title="path/to/kratos/config.yml
session:
  cookie:
    path: /some/sub-directory
```

You can also modify the new
[HTTP Cookie SameSite Attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie/SameSite) using:

```yaml title="path/to/kratos/config.yml
session:
  cookie:
    same_site: Lax
```

To change the cookie name use the following configuration:

```yaml title="path/to/kratos/config.yml
session:
  cookie:
    name: your_cookie_name
```
