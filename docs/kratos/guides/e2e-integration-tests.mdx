title: Writing end-to-end and integration tests
---

We run integration tests for both the [Node.js](https://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-node) and
[React Native](https://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-react-native) reference implementation using
[Cypress](https://www.cypress.io). You can find the set up and source code for these tests in
[./test/e2e/run.sh](https://github.com/ory/kratos/blob/master/test/e2e/run.sh). In principle, we start Ory Kratos with some
configuration and an in-memory database in the background

```sh
DSN=memory hydra serve -c ./path/to/config/kratos.yml --dev > "kratos.e2e.log" 2>&1 &
```

as well as our application in the background as well. Then, we start the Cypress test runner which executes the different e2e
tests. This works really well to test compliance and integration of Ory Kratos.

If you run Ory Kratos and your app on separate domains or ports you might want to add

```json
{
  "chromeWebSecurity": false
}
```

to your `cypress.json` config file.

## Testing React Native on web with Cypress

If you want to test React Native (rendered as a web application) in Cypress, you need to disable security features preventing
browser from executing self-service API flows. To do this, set the environment variable `DEV_DISABLE_API_FLOW_ENFORCEMENT=1`:

```sh
DSN=memory \
    DEV_DISABLE_API_FLOW_ENFORCEMENT=true
    hydra serve -c ./path/to/config/kratos.yml --dev  > "kratos.e2e.log" 2>&1 &)
```
