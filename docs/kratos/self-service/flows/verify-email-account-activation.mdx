Ory allows users to verify email addresses associated with their accounts. This is important to prove that the user has access to
the address they used to create their account. If verification is enabled, Ory Identities starts the verification process
automatically. A user can also verify their address manually.

The verification flow is supported in both browsers and API clients.

:::caution

Email verification should not be taken as a guarantee that the person currently using the account, is the person that verified the
address. It is recommended to implement additional security mechanisms.

:::

## Configuration

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs groupId="oc-or-oss">
  <TabItem value="ocp" label="The Ory Network" default>
```

Account verification can be configured on the **Authentication** → **Email Verification** page in the
[Ory Console](https://console.ory.sh/guides).

```mdx-code-block
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="oss" label="Ory Identities">
```

To enable verification flows, make the following adjustments to your Ory Identities configuration:

```yaml title="config.yml"
selfservice:
  methods:
    code:
      enabled: true
      config:
        # Defines how long the verification or the recovery code is valid for (default 1h)
        lifespan: 15m

  flows:
    verification:
      use: code # Defines which method is used, one of 'code' or 'link'.
      enabled: true

      # Defines how long the verification flow (the UI interaction, not the link!)
      # is valid for (default 1h)
      lifespan: 15m
```

```mdx-code-block
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

### Identity schema

To make an address verifiable, it must be marked as such in the
[identity schema](../../manage-identities/15_customize-identity-schema.mdx). In most cases this is the email address the user
provides when registering their account. Other fields inside the `traits` section are supported as well.

```diff
 {
   "$id": "https://schemas.ory.sh/presets/kratos/quickstart/email-password/identity.schema.json",
   "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
   "title": "Person",
   "type": "object",
   "properties": {
     "traits": {
       "type": "object",
       "properties": {
         "email": {
           "type": "string",
           "format": "email",
           "ory.sh/kratos": {
             "credentials": {
               "password": {
                 "identifier": true
               }
             },
+            "verification": {
+              "via": "email"
+            }
           }
         }
       }
       "additionalProperties": false
     }
   }
 }
```

### Email Templates

Ory Identities (Ory Kratos) comes with default email templates for verification flows.

You can quickly replace the defaults and customize the messages to match the look and feel of your solution. Read the
[custom email template documentation](../../emails-sms/05_custom-email-templates.mdx) to learn more.

:::note

When users attempt to initiate verification for unregistered addresses, the system sends a message to the email address that was
used in the attempt.

This prevents account enumeration attacks as explained in this
[blog post by Troy Hunt](https://www.troyhunt.com/website-enumeration-insanity-how-our-personal-data-is-leaked/).

:::

### Require a verified address for login

Ory Identities supports only allowing users with a verified address to login.

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs groupId="oc-or-oss">
  <TabItem value="ocp" label="The Ory Network" default>
```

Go to **Authentication** → **Email Verification** in the [Ory Console](https://console.ory.sh/projects/current/verification) and
enable **Require Verified Address for Login**.

```mdx-code-block
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="oss" label="Ory Identities">
```

Adjust your Ory Identities (Ory Kratos) configuration as follows:

```diff
selfservice:
  flows:
    login:
+      after:
+        hooks:
+        - hook: require_verified_address
```

For more information see the [hooks configuration](../../hooks/01_configure-hooks.mdx) documentation.

```mdx-code-block
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

## Choosing the right strategy

Ory supports two strategies for verifying your user's addresses.

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="code" label="One-time codes">
```

When using one-time codes to verify a user's address, Ory Identities sends out an email containing a 6-digit code. The user must
enter the code in a dedicated UI text field to verify their address.

Alternatively, the email also contains a link to the form that pre-fills the code if the user clicks on it. The user must still
submit the form for Ory Identities to actually mark the address as verified.

```mdx-code-block
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="oss" label="Magic Links">
```

When using the "magic link" method, Ory Identities sends the user an email with a "magic link". If the user has access to the
email associated with the and clicks the link, Ory Identities marks that address as verified.

```mdx-code-block
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

If the user completes the verification after the link or code expired, they are asked to re-enter their email address and are sent
a new email for verification.

### Comparison

"One-time code" (`code`) is the default, preferred, and recommended method by Ory.

Ory supports "magic links", but considers this method a legacy solution. Currently, the method is supported but should be
considered deprecated and is set to be removed in future releases.

Consider using the `code` method as it mitigates many of the drawbacks of "magic links":

- Some email virus scanners open links in emails to scan them. This invalidates the link and may prevent users from recovering
  their account even if they have the access to the defined recovery address.
- Verification flows initialized by apps on mobile phones or smart devices don't work with links.
- Depending on the device settings, clicking a link from an email can open a different browser than the one used to initialize the
  verification flow. This can confuse your users.

:::caution

When you change the verification strategy from `link` to `code` in an existing project, you might need to adjust your UI. Make
sure the flow works correctly with your UI implementation after changing the recovery strategy.

## Code examples

The user interface for the account verification is a page in your solution that should render the actual form elements for the
user.

In contrast to other identity systems, Ory Identities (Ory Kratos) doesn't render this HTML directly. Instead, you need to
implement the HTML code in your solution, which gives you complete flexibility and customizability in your user interface flows
and designs. This part of your application then directly interfaces with Ory Identities through the API.

The API responds with a JSON document describing the form elements to render and actions the form should take upon submission,
cancellation, etc. The following shows examples for a few different languages and frameworks.

<RenderFlow flow="verification" />
