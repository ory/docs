# Address verification

```mdx-code-block
import CodeTabs from "@theme/Code/CodeTabs"

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs"
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem"
import RenderFlow from "@theme/Code/RenderFlow"
```

Ory allows users to verify email addresses or phone numbers associated with their accounts. This is important to prove that the
user has access to the address they used to create their account. If verification is enabled, Ory Identities starts the
verification process automatically when users sign up. Users can also verify their addresses manually.

The verification flow is supported in both browsers and API clients and can be summarized as the following state machine:

```mdx-code-block
import Mermaid from "@site/src/theme/Mermaid"

<Mermaid
  chart={`
stateDiagram
  s1: Flow is initialized
  s2: User Interface renders Verification Flow Forms
  s3: Update Verification Flow with Error Context(s)
  s4: Verification challenge initiated (link or code via email)
  s5: UI renders code input form (if code, link skips this)
  s6: Show error message and reload form
  s7: Verification completed
  [*] --> s1 : User clicks "Verify Email/SMS/..."
  s1 --> s2
  s2 --> s4 : User provides valid verification data
  s2 --> s3 : User provides invalid verification data
  s3 --> s2
  s4 --> s5
  s5 --> s6 : Challenge response invalid
  s5 --> s7 : Challenge response valid
  s6 --> s5
`}
/>
```

:::caution

Completing account verification doesn't guarantee that the account is used by the person who performed the verification. We
recommend implementing additional security mechanisms to ensure that verified accounts aren't taken over by malicious actors, such
as [TOTP](../../mfa/15_totp.mdx) or [FIDO2/WebAuthn](../../mfa/20_webauthn-fido-yubikey.mdx).

## Configuration

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs groupId="console-or-cli">
<TabItem value="console" label="Ory Console" default>
```

To configure account verification, go to <ConsoleLink route="project.verification" />

:::caution

For SMS verification to work, you'll also need to configure a courier channel with the ID set to `sms` via the CLI. See the
[courier documentation](../../emails-sms/10_sending-sms.mdx) for more information.

:::

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="cli" label="Ory CLI">
```

1. Download the Ory Identities config from your project and save it to a file:

   ```shell
   ## List all available projects
   ory list projects

   ## Get config
   ory get identity-config {project-id} --format yaml > identity-config.yaml
   ```

2. Add the configuration for the verification flow

   ```yaml title="config.yml"
   selfservice:
     methods:
       code: # or link
         enabled: true
         config:
           # Defines how long the verification or the recovery code is valid for (default 1h)
           lifespan: 15m

     flows:
       verification:
         use: code # Defines which method is used, one of 'code' or 'link'.
         enabled: true

         # Defines how long the verification flow (the UI interaction, not the link!)
         # is valid for (default 1h)
         lifespan: 15m

         # Whether to notify unknown addresses, if verification is requested for them
         notify_unknown_recipients: false
   ```

3. Update the Ory Identities configuration using the file you worked with:

   ```shell
   ory update identity-config {project-id} --file updated_config.yaml
   ```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

### Identity schema

To make an address verifiable, it must be marked as such in the
[identity schema](../../manage-identities/15_customize-identity-schema.mdx). In most cases this is the email address the user
provides when registering their account. Other fields inside the `traits` section are supported as well.

```diff title="identity-schema.json"
 {
   "$id": "https://schemas.ory.sh/presets/kratos/quickstart/email-password/identity.schema.json",
   "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
   "title": "Person",
   "type": "object",
   "properties": {
     "traits": {
       "type": "object",
       "properties": {
         "email": {
           "type": "string",
           "format": "email",
           "ory.sh/kratos": {
             "credentials": {
               "password": {
                 "identifier": true
               }
             },
+            "verification": {
+              "via": "email"
+            }
           }
         }
       },
       "additionalProperties": false
     }
   }
 }
```

### Attempted verification notifications

When this option is on and users attempt to initiate verification for unregistered addresses, the system sends an attempted
verification notification to the email address that was used in the attempt. This prevents account enumeration attacks as
explained in this
[blog post by Troy Hunt](https://www.troyhunt.com/website-enumeration-insanity-how-our-personal-data-is-leaked/).

:::info

By default, this feature is disabled in newly created Ory Network projects.

:::

Follow these steps to enable sending attempted verification notifications:

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs groupId="console-or-cli">
<TabItem value="console" label="Ory Console" default>
```

Go to <ConsoleLink route="project.verification" /> and toggle **Notify unknown recipients** on.

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="cli" label="Ory CLI">
```

1. Download the Ory Identities config from your project and save it to a file:

   ```shell
   ## List all available projects
   ory list projects

   ## Get config
   ory get identity-config {project-id} --format yaml > identity-config.yaml
   ```

2. Set `notify_unknown_recipients` to `true`:

   ```yaml title="identity-config.yaml"
   flows:
     verification:
       enabled: true
       lifespan: 15m # Defines how much time the user has to complete the verification flow in the UI. Default: 1h.
       use: code # Defines which method is used, one of 'code' or 'link'.
       notify_unknown_recipients: true # Defines if the system sends attempted verification notifications to unregistered addresses.
   ```

3. Update the Ory Identities configuration using the file you worked with:

   ```shell
   ory update identity-config {project-id} --file identity-config.yaml
   ```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

### Email templates

Ory Identities comes with default email templates for verification flows.

You can quickly replace the defaults and customize the messages to match the look and feel of your solution. Read the
[custom email template documentation](../../emails-sms/05_custom-email-templates.mdx) to learn more.

### Allow login only with verified email

To allow only the users with a verified email to sign in, follow these steps:

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs groupId="console-or-cli">
<TabItem value="console" label="Ory Console" default>
```

Go to <ConsoleLink route="project.verification" /> and enable **Require Verified Address for Login**.

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="cli" label="Ory CLI">
```

1. Download the Ory Identities config from your project and save it to a file:

   ```shell
   ## List all available projects
   ory list projects

   ## Get config
   ory get identity-config {project-id} --format yaml > identity-config.yaml
   ```

2. Add the configuration for the verification flow

   ```diff
   selfservice:
     flows:
       login:
   +      after:
   +        hooks:
   +        - hook: require_verified_address
   ```

3. Update the Ory Identities configuration using the file you worked with:

   ```shell
   ory update identity-config {project-id} --file updated_config.yaml
   ```

:::tip

For more information see the [hooks configuration](../../hooks/01_configure-hooks.mdx) documentation.

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

### Carry over verified status from Social Sign-In

Some Social Sign-In providers like Google return the verified status of the email address. To carry over the verified status from
the Social Sign-In provider, return `verified_addresses` in your Social Sign-In Jsonnet snippet:

```jsonnet
local claims = {
  email_verified: false,
} + std.extVar('claims');

{
  identity: {
    traits: {
      [if 'email' in claims && claims.email_verified then 'email' else null]: claims.email,
      given_name: claims.given_name,
      family_name: claims.family_name,
    },
    verified_addresses: std.prune([
      // Carry over verified status from Social Sign-In provider.
      if 'email' in claims && claims.email_verified then { via: 'email', value: claims.email },
    ]),
  },
}
```

Please note that this only works if the verified address is also present in the identity's traits and marked as a verifiable
email.

```json5 title="Example identity schema"
{
  $id: "https://example.com/person.schema.json",
  $schema: "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  title: "Person",
  type: "object",
  properties: {
    traits: {
      type: "object",
      properties: {
        email: {
          format: "email",
          type: "string",
          "ory.sh/kratos": {
            // highlight-start
            verification: {
              via: "email",
            },
            // highlight-end
          },
        },
      },
      required: ["subject"],
    },
  },
}
```

If the verified address is not present in the identity's traits, the verified status is not carried over.

## Phone number verification

To send SMS messages, you need to have a trait in your identity schema that holds the phone number. The trait must be marked as a
verifiable address via the `verification` extension. Here's an example of how to define such a trait in the identity schema:

```json
{
  "$id": "https://schemas.ory.sh/presets/kratos/quickstart/phone-password/identity.schema.json",
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "title": "Person",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "traits": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "email": {
          "type": "string",
          "title": "E-Mail",
          "format": "email",
          "ory.sh/kratos": {
            "credentials": {
              "password": {
                "identifier": true
              }
            },
            "verification": {
              "via": "email"
            }
          }
        },
        "phone": {
          "type": "string",
          "title": "Phone number",
          "format": "tel",
          "ory.sh/kratos": {
            // highlight-start
            "verification": {
              "via": "sms"
            }
            // highlight-end
          }
        }
      },
      "additionalProperties": false
    }
  }
}
```

Make sure to configure an SMS channel in the Ory configuration. See the [SMS documentation](../../emails-sms/10_sending-sms.mdx).

## Choosing the right strategy

Ory supports two strategies for verifying your user's addresses.

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="code" label="One-time codes">
```

When using one-time codes to verify a user's address, Ory Identities sends an email with a 6-digit code to the user. They must
enter the code in a dedicated UI text field to verify their address.

The email also contains a link, that takes the user to the verification form with the code pre-filled in the appropriate form
field. The only thing the user must do to verify their address is to submit the form.

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="link" label="Magic Links">
```

When using the "magic link" method, Ory Identities sends the user an email with a verification link. If the user has access to the
email associated with the account and clicks the link, Ory Identities marks that address as verified.

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

If the user completes the verification after the link or code expired, they must provide the email address associated with their
account to get a new verification email.

### Comparison

```mdx-code-block
import CodeLinkComparison from "./_common/code-link-comparison.mdx"

<CodeLinkComparison />
```

## Showing the verification flow after settings, registration or login

To show the verification flow directly after the user has registered, see the
[registration documentation](../../../identities/sign-in/actions.mdx#show-verification-after-successful-registration).

For settings, see the [settings documentation](./user-settings.mdx#show-verification-after-updating-a-verifiable-address).

And for login, see the
[login customization documentation](../../../identities/sign-in/actions.mdx#show-verification-after-login-if-address-is-not-verified-yet).

## Code examples

The user interface for account verification is a page in your solution that renders the actual form elements for the user.

In contrast to other identity systems, Ory Identities (Ory Kratos) doesn't render this HTML directly. Instead, you need to
implement the HTML code in your solution, which gives you complete flexibility and customizability in your user interface flows
and designs. This part of your application then directly interfaces with Ory Identities through the API.

The API responds with a JSON document describing the form elements to render and actions the form should take upon submission,
cancellation, etc. The following shows examples for a few different languages and frameworks.

<RenderFlow flow="verification" />
