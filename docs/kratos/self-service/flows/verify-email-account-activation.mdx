# Email and phone verification

```mdx-code-block
import CodeTabs from "@theme/Code/CodeTabs"

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs"
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem"
import RenderFlow from "@theme/Code/RenderFlow"
```

Ory allows users to verify email addresses associated with their accounts. This is important to prove that the user has access to
the address they used to create their account. If verification is enabled, Ory Identities starts the verification process
automatically when users sign up. Users can also verify their addresses manually.

The verification flow is supported in both browsers and API clients.

:::caution

Completing account verification doesn't guarantee that the account is used by the person who performed the verification. We
recommend implementing additional security mechanisms to ensure that verified accounts aren't taken over by malicious actors.

## Configuration

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs groupId="console-or-cli">
  <TabItem value="console" label="Ory Console" default>
```

To configure account verification, go to **Authentication** → **Email Verification** in the
[Ory Console](https://console.ory.sh/projects/current/verification).

```mdx-code-block
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="cli" label="Ory CLI">
```

1. Download the Ory Identities config from your project and save it to a file:

   ```shell
   ## List all available projects
   ory list projects

   ## Get config
   ory get identity-config {project-id} --format yaml > identity-config.yaml
   ```

2. Add the configuration for the verification flow

   ```yaml title="config.yml"
   selfservice:
     methods:
       code: # or link
         enabled: true
         config:
           # Defines how long the verification or the recovery code is valid for (default 1h)
           lifespan: 15m

     flows:
       verification:
         use: code # Defines which method is used, one of 'code' or 'link'.
         enabled: true

         # Defines how long the verification flow (the UI interaction, not the link!)
         # is valid for (default 1h)
         lifespan: 15m
   ```

3. Update the Ory Identities configuration using the file you worked with:

   ```shell
   ory update identity-config {project-id} --file updated_config.yaml
   ```

```mdx-code-block
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

### Identity schema

To make an address verifiable, it must be marked as such in the
[identity schema](../../manage-identities/15_customize-identity-schema.mdx). In most cases this is the email address the user
provides when registering their account. Other fields inside the `traits` section are supported as well.

```diff title="identity-schema.json"
 {
   "$id": "https://schemas.ory.sh/presets/kratos/quickstart/email-password/identity.schema.json",
   "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
   "title": "Person",
   "type": "object",
   "properties": {
     "traits": {
       "type": "object",
       "properties": {
         "email": {
           "type": "string",
           "format": "email",
           "ory.sh/kratos": {
             "credentials": {
               "password": {
                 "identifier": true
               }
             },
+            "verification": {
+              "via": "email"
+            }
           }
         }
       }
       "additionalProperties": false
     }
   }
 }
```

### Email templates

Ory Identities comes with default email templates for verification flows.

You can quickly replace the defaults and customize the messages to match the look and feel of your solution. Read the
[custom email template documentation](../../emails-sms/05_custom-email-templates.mdx) to learn more.

:::note

When users attempt to initiate verification for unregistered addresses, the system sends a message to the email address that was
used in the attempt.

This prevents account enumeration attacks as explained in this
[blog post by Troy Hunt](https://www.troyhunt.com/website-enumeration-insanity-how-our-personal-data-is-leaked/).

### Allow login only with verified email

To allow only the users with a verified email to sign in, follow these steps:

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs groupId="console-or-cli">
  <TabItem value="console" label="Ory Console" default>
```

Go to **Authentication** → **Email Verification** in the [Ory Console](https://console.ory.sh/projects/current/verification) and
enable **Require Verified Address for Login**.

```mdx-code-block
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="cli" label="Ory CLI">
```

1. Download the Ory Identities config from your project and save it to a file:

   ```shell
   ## List all available projects
   ory list projects

   ## Get config
   ory get identity-config {project-id} --format yaml > identity-config.yaml
   ```

2. Add the configuration for the verification flow

   ```diff
   selfservice:
     flows:
       login:
   +      after:
   +        hooks:
   +        - hook: require_verified_address
   ```

3. Update the Ory Identities configuration using the file you worked with:

   ```shell
   ory update identity-config {project-id} --file updated_config.yaml
   ```

:::tip

For more information see the [hooks configuration](../../hooks/01_configure-hooks.mdx) documentation.

```mdx-code-block
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

## Choosing the right strategy

Ory supports two strategies for verifying your user's addresses.

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="code" label="One-time codes">
```

When using one-time codes to verify a user's address, Ory Identities sends an email with a 6-digit code to the user. They must
enter the code in a dedicated UI text field to verify their address.

The email also contains a link, that takes the user to the verification form with the code pre-filled in the appropriate form
field. The only thing the user must do to verify their address is to submit the form.

```mdx-code-block
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="link" label="Magic Links">
```

When using the "magic link" method, Ory Identities sends the user an email with a verification link. If the user has access to the
email associated with the account and clicks the link, Ory Identities marks that address as verified.

```mdx-code-block
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

If the user completes the verification after the link or code expired, they must provide the email address associated with their
account to get a new verification email.

### Comparison

```mdx-code-block
import CodeLinkComparison from "./_common/code-link-comparison.mdx"

<CodeLinkComparison />
```

## Code examples

The user interface for account verification is a page in your solution that renders the actual form elements for the user.

In contrast to other identity systems, Ory Identities (Ory Kratos) doesn't render this HTML directly. Instead, you need to
implement the HTML code in your solution, which gives you complete flexibility and customizability in your user interface flows
and designs. This part of your application then directly interfaces with Ory Identities through the API.

The API responds with a JSON document describing the form elements to render and actions the form should take upon submission,
cancellation, etc. The following shows examples for a few different languages and frameworks.
