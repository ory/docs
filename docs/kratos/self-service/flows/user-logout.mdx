```mdx-code-block
import { apiFlow } from "./code/logout"
import CodeTabs from "@theme/Code/CodeTabs"
import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs"
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem"
import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock"
```

The logout flow is used to terminate an Ory Identities session. Ory provides logout on all supported clients:

- [Server-rendered browser applications](#server-rendered-browser-applications)
- [Single page application (SPA)](#single-page-application-spa)
- [Native API applications](#native-api-applications)

## Server-rendered browser applications

To ensure that logging out is performed by the user intentionally, Ory Identities first generates a logout URL for a given Ory
Session cookie. You can then open the logout URL in the browser.

The logout URL is valid for the duration of the user's session. This means that you can call the endpoint before the user decides
they want to log out and cache the logout URL. You can then use the cached URL when the user performs the action required to log
out, for example, accesses a designated UI element.

```mdx-code-block
import express from "!!raw-loader!@site/code-examples/sdk/typescript/src/selfservice/logout/express.ts"

<CodeBlock language="ts" title="express-logout.ts">{express}</CodeBlock>
```

### Post-logout redirect

After a successful logout, the system redirects the browser to the address defined in the `return_to` query parameter of the
logout request URL. If the parameter is omitted, the default post logout return URL is used.

To set the default post-logout return URL:

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs group="console-or-cli">
  <TabItem value="console" label="Ory Console" default>
```

Go to **Browser Redirects** and set the URL in the **Post-Logout Redirect** field in the
[Ory Console](https://console.ory.sh/projects/current/browser-redirects).

```mdx-code-block
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="cli" label="Ory CLI">
```

Run this command in the [Ory CLI](../../../guides/cli/01_installation.mdx):

```shell
ory patch identity-config {project-id} \
   --replace '/selfservice/flows/logout/after/default_browser_return_url="{return-url}"'
```

```mdx-code-block
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

If an error occurs, the browser is redirected to the [Error UI](./user-facing-errors.md).

## Single page application (SPA)

Similar to server-side browser applications, Ory Identities first generates a logout URL for a given Ory Session cookie. However,
you can simply call the logout URL using an AJAX request.

The following example requires the [Ory Tunnel](../../../guides/cli/20_proxy-and-tunnel.mdx).

```mdx-code-block
import react from "!!raw-loader!@site/code-examples/sdk/typescript/src/selfservice/logout/react.tsx"

<CodeBlock language="ts" title="react-logout.tsx">{react}</CodeBlock>
```

## Native API applications

API clients (such as native mobile apps) use Ory Session Tokens. To revoke such a token, call the logout API endpoint directly.

```mdx-code-block
<CodeTabs items={apiFlow} />
```
