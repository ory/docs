```mdx-code-block
import { apiFlow, browserFlow, spaFlow } from "./code/logout"
import CodeTabs from "@site/src/theme/Code/CodeTabs"
import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs"
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem"
```

The logout flow is used to terminate an Ory Identities session.

Ory supports logout on all supported clients:

- [Server rendered browser applications](#server-side-browser-applications)
- [Client side browser applications](#client-side-browser-applications)
- [Native applications](#native-api-applications)

## Server-side browser applications

To ensure that a logout was intended by the user, Ory Identities first generates a logout URL for a given Ory Session cookie. You
can then open the logout URL in the browser.

In practice, it is recommended to call the endpoint every time you want to show a logout button to the user.

Alternatively, you can create the logout URL only when the user actually clicks the logout button and immediately call the
resulting `logout_url` from your server to log out the user. Beware, that this method can lead to inconsistent behavior for users
that switch accounts often.

### After logout redirects

After successful logout, the browser will be redirected either to the `return_to` query parameter from the initial request URL, or
fall back to the default post logout return URL.

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs group="oc-vs-oss">
  <TabItem value="oc" label="The Ory Network" default>
```

You can set a default return URL in the [Ory Console](https://console.ory.sh/projects/current/browser-redirects) on the **Browser
Redirects** page using the **Post-Logout Redirect** value.

```mdx-code-block
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="oss" label="Ory Identities">
```

```yaml
selfservice:
  flows:
    logout:
      after:
        default_browser_return_url: http://test.ory.sh:4000/
```

```mdx-code-block
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

If an error occurs, the browser is redirected to the [Error UI](./user-facing-errors.md).

## Client-side browser applications

Similar to server-side browser applications, Ory Identities first generates a logout URL for a given Ory Session Cookie. However,
you can simply call the logout URL using an AJAX request.

The following example requires the [Ory Tunnel](../../../guides/cli/20_proxy-and-tunnel.mdx).

## Native API applications

API clients (such as native mobile apps) use Ory Session Tokens. To revoke such a token, call the logout API endpoint directly.
