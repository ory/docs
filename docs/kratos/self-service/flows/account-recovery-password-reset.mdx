# Account recovery and password reset

Account recovery allows registered users to regain access to their account if they forget their password or lose access to the
second authentication factor required for multifactor authentication (MFA).

To regain access to their account, the user must prove that they are the owner of the account. The verification of ownership is
performed using the [recovery address defined by the user](#account-recovery-address). When the account recovery flow is
initiated, the system sends a link or a one-time code to the recovery address defined by the user. The user must access the link
or enter the code they received to confirm their identity and ownership of the account.

When the user accesses the configured recovery method, they receive a
[privileged session](../../session-management/overview#privileged-sessions) and are taken to their account's settings page where
they must create a new password to regain access to their account.

:::info

The account recovery flow doesn't reset user's second authentication factor.

## Supported recovery strategies

Ory Identities (Ory Kratos) supports two recovery strategies:

- Recovery by one-time passwords (`code`)
- Recovery by magic links (`link`)

### Comparison

The "one-time password" method (`code`) is the default, preferred, and recommended by Ory.

Ory supports magic links, but considers this method a legacy solution. Currently, the method is supported but should be
considered deprecated and is set to be removed in future releases.

Consider using the `code` method as it mitigates many of the drawbacks of magic links that you must consider:

- Some email virus scanners open links in emails to scan them. This invalidates the magic link and may prevent users from
  recovering their account even if they have the access to the defined recovery address.
- Recovery flows initialized by apps on mobile phones or smart devices don't work with magic links.
- Depending on the device settings, clicking a magic link can open a different browser than the one used to initialize the
  recovery flow. This can confuse your users.

:::caution

When you change the recovery method from `link` to `code` in an existing project, you might need to adjust your UI. Make sure
the flow works correctly with your UI implementation after changing the recovery method.

:::

## Configuration

````mdx-code-block
<Tabs groupId="oc-or-oss">
<TabItem value="oc" label="Ory Network" default>

To enable account recovery and adjust related options, go to **Authentication** → **Account Recovery** in the [Ory Console](https://console.ory.sh/guides)

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="oss" label="Self-hosted Ory Kratos config">

You can enable and configure account recovery in the Ory Kratos config:

```yaml title="path/to/my/kratos/config.yml"
selfservice:
methods:
 code: # Enables "one-time code" method. Use 'link' to enable "magic link" method.
   enabled: true
   config:
     lifespan: 15m # Defines how long the code or link are valid for. Default: 1h.

flows:
 recovery:
   enabled: true
   lifespan: 15m  # Defines how much time the user has to complete the recovery flow in the UI. Default: 1h.
   use: code # Defines which method is used, one of 'code' or 'link'.
```

Both strategies require sending emails to users. This means that you must configure an SMTP server for your instance.
[Read this document](../../emails-sms/sending-emails-smtp) to learn more.

### Account recovery address

To start account recovery, Ory Identities (Ory Kratos) must know which address to send the recovery message to. In most cases this
is the email address the user provides when registering their account. Other fields inside the `traits` section are supported as
well.

:::info

If the email address used for recovery is the same as the email used for verification and the account is not activated when the
recovery flow is initiated, completing the recovery flow also verifies the user's email address.

Read [this document](./verify-email-account-activation) to learn about the account activation flow.

:::

To specify a trait of the identity to be used for recovery, use the following identity schema:

```diff
 {
   "$id": "https://schemas.ory.sh/presets/kratos/quickstart/email-password/identity.schema.json",
   "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
   "title": "Person",
   "type": "object",
   "properties": {
     "traits": {
       "type": "object",
       "properties": {
         "email": {
           "type": "string",
           "format": "email",
           "ory.sh/kratos": {
             "credentials": {
               "password": {
                 "identifier": true
               }
             },
+            "recovery": {
+              "via": "email"
+            }
           }
         }
       }
       "additionalProperties": false
     }
   }
 }
```

### Email templates

Ory Identities (Ory Kratos) comes with default email templates for recovery flows.

You can quickly replace the defaults and customize the messages to match the look and feel of your solution. Read
[this document](../../emails-sms/custom-email-templates) to learn more.

:::caution

When users attempt to initiate recovery for unregistered addresses, the system sends a message to the email address that was used
in the attempt.

This prevents account enumeration attacks as explained in this
[blog post by Troy Hunt](https://www.troyhunt.com/website-enumeration-insanity-how-our-personal-data-is-leaked/).

:::

## Invalidate other sessions

In some scenarios it can be useful to revoke all active sessions of the user when they successfully recover their account. This
forces anyone with access to the account to re-authenticate using the new password set up in the recovery process.

To trigger this behavior, use the `after_recovery` hook:

````mdx-code-block
<Tabs groupId="oc-or-oss">
<TabItem value="oc" label="Ory Network" default>

1. Get the Ory Identities config with Ory CLI:

   ```shell
   ## List all available projects
   ory list projects

   ## Get config
   ory get identity-config <project-id> --format yaml > identity-config.yaml
   ```

2. Add the hook configuration to the downloaded file.

    ```diff
    selfservice:
      flows:
        recovery:
          enabled: true
          ui_url: http://your.ui/recovery
    +      after:
    +        hooks:
    +        - hook: revoke_active_sessions
    ```

3. Update the Ory Identities configuration using the file you worked with:

   ```shell
   ory update identity-config <project-id> --file updated_config.yaml
   ```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="oss" label="Self-hosted Ory Kratos config">

Edit your Ory Kratos configuration file:

```diff
 selfservice:
   flows:
     recovery:
       enabled: true
       ui_url: http://127.0.0.1:4455/recovery
+      after:
+        hooks:
+        - hook: revoke_active_sessions
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
````

## Code examples for Node.js, React.js, Go

The user interface for the account recovery is a page in your solution that should render the actual render the actual form
elements for the user.

In contrast to other identity systems, Ory Identities (Ory Kratos) doesn't render this HTML directly. Instead, you need to
implement the HTML code in your solution, which gives you complete flexibility and customizability in your user interface flows
and designs. This part of your application then directly interfaces with Ory Identities through the API.

The API responds with a JSON document describing the form elements to render and actions the form should take upon submission,
cancellation, etc. The following shows examples for a few different languages and frameworks.
