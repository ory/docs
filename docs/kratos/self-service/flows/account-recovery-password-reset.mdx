# Account recovery and password reset

```mdx-code-block
import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs"
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem"
import RenderFlow from "@theme/Code/RenderFlow"
```

Account recovery allows registered users to regain access to their account if they forget their password or lose access to the
second authentication factor required for multifactor authentication (MFA).

To regain access to their account, the user must prove that they are the owner of the account. The verification of ownership is
performed using the [recovery address defined by the user](#account-recovery-address). When the account recovery flow is
initiated, the system sends a link or a one-time code to the recovery address defined by the user. The user must access the link
or enter the code they received to confirm their identity and ownership of the account.

When the user accesses the configured recovery method, they receive a
[privileged session](../../session-management/overview#privileged-sessions) and are taken to their account's settings page where
they must create a new password to regain access to their account.

:::info

The account recovery flow doesn't reset user's second authentication factor.

## Supported recovery methods

Ory Identities (Ory Kratos) supports two recovery methods:

- Recovery by one-time codes (`code`)
- Recovery by magic links (`link`)

### Comparison

```mdx-code-block
import CodeLinkComparison from "./_common/code-link-comparison.mdx"

<CodeLinkComparison />
```

## Configuration

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs groupId="console-or-cli" defaultValue="console">
  <TabItem value="console" label="Ory Console">
```

To enable account recovery and adjust related options, go to **Authentication** â†’ **Account Recovery** in the
[Ory Console](https://console.ory.sh/guides).

```mdx-code-block
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="cli" label="Ory CLI">
```

1. Download the Ory Identities config from your project and save it to a file:

   ```shell
   ## List all available projects
   ory list projects

   ## Get config
   ory get identity-config {project-id} --format yaml > identity-config.yaml
   ```

2. Add the configuration for the verification flow

   ```yaml title="config.yml"
   selfservice:
   methods:
   code: # Enables "one-time code" method. Use 'link' to enable "magic link" method.
     enabled: true
     config:
       lifespan: 15m # Defines how long the code or link are valid for. Default: 1h.

   flows:
   recovery:
     enabled: true
     lifespan: 15m # Defines how much time the user has to complete the recovery flow in the UI. Default: 1h.
     use: code # Defines which method is used, one of 'code' or 'link'.
   ```

3. Update the Ory Identities configuration using the file you worked with:

   ```shell
   ory update identity-config {project-id} --file updated_config.yaml
   ```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

### Enforce multifactor authentication

By default, the account recovery process gives users a privileged session without the need to provide the second authentication
factor. You can choose to require multifactor authentication for account recovery.

:::note

This affect all users, not only those that recover their accounts. If you enable this setting, all users must provide their second
authentication to adjust profile settings.

:::

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs groupId="console-or-cli">
  <TabItem value="console" label="Ory Console" default>
```

In the Ory Console go to **Two-Factor Authentication** and disable **Allow Self-Service Settings without Second Factor**.

```mdx-code-block
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="cli" label="Ory CLI">
```

1. Download the Ory Identities config from your project and save it to a file:

   ```shell
   ## List all available projects
   ory list projects

   ## Get config
   ory get identity-config {project-id} --format yaml > identity-config.yaml
   ```

2. Add the configuration for the verification flow

   ```yaml title="path/to/my/kratos/config.yml"
   selfservice:
     flows:
       settings:
         required_aal: highest_available
   ```

3. Update the Ory Identities configuration using the file you worked with:

   ```shell
   ory update identity-config {project-id} --file updated_config.yaml
   ```

```mdx-code-block
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

### Account recovery address

To start account recovery, Ory Identities (Ory Kratos) must know which address to send the recovery message to. In most cases this
is the email address the user provides when registering their account. Other fields inside the `traits` section are supported as
well.

:::info

If the email address used for recovery is the same as the email used for verification and the account is not activated when the
recovery flow is initiated, completing the recovery flow also verifies the user's email address.

Read [this document](./verify-email-account-activation) to learn about the account activation flow.

:::

To specify a trait of the identity to be used for recovery, use the following identity schema:

```diff
 {
   "$id": "https://schemas.ory.sh/presets/kratos/quickstart/email-password/identity.schema.json",
   "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
   "title": "Person",
   "type": "object",
   "properties": {
     "traits": {
       "type": "object",
       "properties": {
         "email": {
           "type": "string",
           "format": "email",
           "ory.sh/kratos": {
             "credentials": {
               "password": {
                 "identifier": true
               }
             },
+            "recovery": {
+              "via": "email"
+            }
           }
         }
       }
       "additionalProperties": false
     }
   }
 }
```

### Email templates

Ory Identities (Ory Kratos) comes with default email templates for recovery flows.

You can quickly replace the defaults and customize the messages to match the look and feel of your solution. Read the
[custom email template documentation](../../emails-sms/custom-email-templates) to learn more.

:::note

When users attempt to initiate recovery for unregistered addresses, the system sends a message to the email address that was used
in the attempt.

This prevents account enumeration attacks as explained in this
[blog post by Troy Hunt](https://www.troyhunt.com/website-enumeration-insanity-how-our-personal-data-is-leaked/).

:::

## Invalidate other sessions

In some scenarios it can be useful to revoke all active sessions of the user when they successfully recover their account. This
forces anyone with access to the account to re-authenticate using the new password set up in the recovery process.

To trigger this behavior, use the `after_recovery` hook:

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="cli" label="Ory CLI" default>
```

1. Get the Ory Identities config with Ory CLI:

   ```shell
   ## List all available projects
   ory list projects

   ## Get config
   ory get identity-config <project-id> --format yaml > identity-config.yaml
   ```

2. Add the hook configuration to the downloaded file.

   ```diff
   selfservice:
     flows:
       recovery:
         enabled: true
         ui_url: http://your.ui/recovery
   +      after:
   +        hooks:
   +        - hook: revoke_active_sessions
   ```

3. Update the Ory Identities configuration using the file you worked with:

   ```shell
   ory update identity-config <project-id> --file updated_config.yaml
   ```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

:::tip

For more information see the [hooks configuration](../../hooks/01_configure-hooks.mdx) documentation.

## Code examples

The user interface for the account recovery is a page in your solution that should render the actual form elements for the user.

In contrast to other identity systems, Ory Identities (Ory Kratos) doesn't render this HTML directly. Instead, you need to
implement the HTML code in your solution, which gives you complete flexibility and customizability in your user interface flows
and designs. This part of your application then directly interfaces with Ory Identities through the API.

The API responds with a JSON document describing the form elements to render and actions the form should take upon submission,
cancellation, etc. The following shows examples for a few different languages and frameworks.
