"One-time code" (`code`) is the default, preferred, and recommended method by Ory.

Ory supports "magic links", but considers this method a legacy solution. Currently, the method is supported but should be
considered deprecated and is set to be removed in future releases.

Consider using the `code` method as it mitigates many of the drawbacks of "magic links":

- Some email virus scanners open links in emails to scan them. This invalidates the link and may prevent users from completing the
  flow even if they have the access to the defined address.
- Flows initialized by apps on mobile phones or smart devices don't work with links.
- Depending on the device settings, clicking a link from an email can open a different browser than the one used to initialize the
  flow. This can confuse your users.

:::caution

When you change the strategy from `link` to `code` in an existing project, you might need to adjust your UI. Make sure the flow
works correctly with your UI implementation after changing the strategy.
