Ory Identities (Kratos) allows you to enrich self-service user flows by executing additional logic at specific points of the
selected flow. This includes calling external services, for example, Mailchimp, Segment, HubSpot, or Zapier. You enrich the flows
through hooks.

Adding hooks to self-service flows can help you shape your customers' user experience, increase the security of your solution by
adding additional verifications, and exchange information with external systems.

## When can you use hooks?

You can use hooks at specific points of select self-service flows:

- `before` login: The hook runs when the user starts the login flow.
- `after` login: The hook runs when the user is successfully authenticated, before the system issues an Ory Session.
- `before` registration: The hook runs when a registration flow starts.
- `after` registration: The hook runs when a user successfully registers in the system.
- `before` recovery: The hook runs when the user starts the recovery flow.
- `after` recovery: The hook runs when the user successfully recovers their password.
- `before` settings: The hook runs when the user starts the account settings flow.
- `after` settings: The hook runs when the user successfully changes their account settings.
- `before` verification: The hook runs when the user starts the verification flow.
- `after` verification: The hook runs when the user verifies their account.

### Hooks for specific methods

The login and registration self-service flows support multiple authentication methods:

| Authentication method | Description                                                                                    |
| :-------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `password`            | Sign-in and sign-up with username and password combo.                                          |
| `oidc`                | Sign-in and sign-up through OIDC-compliant OAuth2 identity providers.                          |
| `totp`                | Sign-in with a TOTP code from apps such as Google Authenticator.                               |
| `webauthn`            | Sign-in with WebAuthn-compatible factors (FaceID, YubiKey) or paswordless sign-up and sign-in. |
| `lookup_secret`       | Sign-in with recovery codes.                                                                   |

:::tip

You can use the authentication methods to further specify when you want to run hooks. For example, you can run a hook for the
login flow with the `password` method and not run any hooks for logins with the `oidc` method.

:::

## Available hooks

There are 4 hooks you can use to extend self-service user flows. Note that some hooks can only be used for specific flows and
methods.

| Hook                       | Description                                                                                       | Constraints                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| :------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `session`                  | Signs in the user immediately after they create an account.                                       | For use only with the `after` registration flow. To use it, you must define secrets for secret rotation.                                                                                                |
| `revoke_active_sessions`   | Revokes all other active sessions of the user on successful login.                                | For use only with the login flow.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `require_verified_address` | Allows users to sign in only when they verified their email address.                              | For use only with the `after` login flow, `password` method only.                                                                                                                                       |
| `web_hook`                 | Allows to trigger external logic. Can be used with all flows and methods except error and logout. | Requires providing web-hook configuration. The only hook type available for the `after` settings flow. See an example of using webhooks [here](../../guides/integrate-with-ory-cloud-through-webhooks). |

## Configuration

````mdx-code-block
import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock'
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs groupId="wherehosted">
  <TabItem value="cloud" label="The Ory Network" default>

To add hooks to flows:

1. Get the Ory Identities config with Ory CLI:

   ```shell
   ## List all available projects
   ory list projects

   ## Get config
   ory get identity-config <project-id> --format yaml > identity-config.yaml
   ```

2. Add the hook configuration to the downloaded file.
3. Update the Ory Identities configuration using the file you worked with:

   ```shell
   ory update identity-config <project-id> --file updated_config.yaml
   ```


  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="selfhosted" label="Self-Hosted Ory Kratos Config" default>

To add hooks to flows, edit the Ory Kratos configuration file.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
````

### Add hooks for all methods of a flow

To configure hooks for all methods of a particular flow, use this pattern:

```yaml
selfservice:
  flows:
    login: # Defines for which flow triggers the hook. No method defined = applies to all methods.
      before: # Defines the point at which the hook runs.
        hooks:
          - hook: <hook 1 name> # Specifies which hook is triggered.
```

### Add hooks for particular method of a flow

To configure hooks for a particular flow method, use this pattern:

```yaml
selfservice:
  flows:
    registration: # Defines for which flow triggers the hook.
      after: # Defines the point at which the hook runs.
        password: # When method is defined, the hook is triggered only for this particular method and flow.
          hooks:
            - hook: <hook 1 name> # Specifies which hook is triggered.
```

#### Hook precedence

Hooks configured on the method level always override the hooks configured on the flow level. When you apply the following hook
configuration, `hook_1` always runs when the login flow is started. On the finalization of the flow, `hook_2` runs only for
methods other than `password`. If the `password` method is used, the system triggers `hook_3`.

```yaml
selfservice:
  flows:
    login:
      before:
        hooks:
          - hook: hook_1
      after:
        hooks:
          - hook: hook_2
        password:
          hooks:
            - hook: hook_3
```

### `session` hook configuration

To use the `session` hook you must define secrets for secret rotation:

```yaml
secrets:
  cookie:
    - something-super-secret # The first entry will be used to sign and verify session cookies

    # All other entries will be used to verify session cookies that were signed before
    # "something-super-secret" became the current signing secret.
    - old-session-secret
    - older-session-secret
    - ancient-session-secret

selfservice:
  flows:
    registration:
      after:
        oidc:
          hooks:
            - hook: session
```

#### Behavior depending on registration flow

The hook behaves differently depending on the registration flow used:

- Registration through a web browser

  The hook sends a `Set-Cookie` HTTP header which contains the session cookie. The user is signed in immediately.

  :::warning

  Using this job as part of your post-registration workflow makes your system vulnerable to Account Enumeration Attacks because a
  threat agent can distinguish between existing and non-existing accounts by checking if Set-Cookie was sent as part of the
  registration response.

  :::

- Registration through the API (mobile app)

  When the registration is performed through an API client (such as a mobile app), the hook creates a session and returns the
  session token and the session itself in the response body as `application/json`:

  ```json
  {
    "session": {
      "id": "..."
      // ...
    },
    "session_token": "...",
    "identity": {
      "id": "..."
      // ...
    }
  }
  ```

:::info

The HTTP response is set by the hook. As a result, no other hooks can be executed after the `session` hook. This is because the
initial HTTP response can't be modified by subsequent hooks.

If you want to trigger multiple hooks in your setup, make sure that `session` is the last executed hook.

:::

### Webhooks

To configure webhooks, use this pattern:

````mdx-code-block
<Tabs groupId="wherehosted">
  <TabItem value="cloud" label="The Ory Network" default>

```yaml
selfservice:
  flows:
    login:
      before:
        hooks:
          - hook: web_hook # To use webhooks, you must set 'hook' to 'web_hook'
            config:
              url: https://test.hook.site.sh/before_login_hook # Webhook URL.
              method: POST # HTTP method used to send request to the webhook URL.
              body: base64://ENCODED_JSONNET # Encoded Jsonnet template used to render payload.
              # Ignored when using an HTTP method that doesn't allow sending body. OPTIONAL
              can_interrupt: true # Defines if the webhook can interrupt the flow. Boolean. OPTIONAL
              auth:
                type: # Can be one of 'basic_auth' or 'api_key'
                config: # Additional auth config for the hook. Read next section for details.
```

| Setting | Mandatory | Description
| :------ | :-------: | :--------- |
| `url`   | Yes | URL called by the webhook. |
| `method`| Yes | HTTP method used to send a request to the webhook URL. |
| `body`  | No | Base64-encoded Jsonnet template used to render the payload. Ignored when using an HTTP method that doesn't allow sending body.|
| `can_interrupt`  | No | Defines if the webhook can interrupt the flow. |
| `auth`  | No | Webhook authentication mechanism configuration. |

:::info

Webhooks can't control the execution of the flow by patching/updating particular properties of flow-specific objects on webhook
completion.

The execution of the flow can be canceled if the call to the webhook endpoint fails either due to a network error or if the
endpoint returns an HTTP code `4xx` or `5xx` response.

:::

#### Request body

Webhooks bind the `flow`, as well as request headers (`request_headers`), request method (`request_method`), and the request URL
(`request_url`) of the flow into the Jsonnet template for all methods and execution paths (before and after). For the `after`
execution path of all flows, it binds the `identity` object into the Jsonnet template as well. These objects are available through
a `ctx` object.

To send `{ user_id: <some-id> }` in the request body, create the following the Jsonnet template:

```jsonnet
function(ctx) { user_id: ctx.identity.id }
```

#### Authentication and authorization in webhooks

For `auth` following mechanisms are supported:

- API key authentication. Type must be set to `api_key`. All properties are mandatory.

  ```yaml
  - hook: web_hook
    # <other configuration keys>
    config:
      auth:
        type: api_key
        config:
          name: Authorization
          value: The-Value-of-My-Key
          in: header # alternatively "cookie"
  ```

- "Basic Authentication" type authentication. Type must be set to `basic_auth`. All properties are mandatory.

  For `basic_auth` the config looks as follows:

  ```yaml
  - hook: web_hook
    # <other configuration keys>
    config:
      auth:
        type: basic_auth
        config:
          user: My-User
          password: My-Pass-Value
  ```

#### Canceling webhooks

You can cancel configured webhooks and not make the defined request.

This can come in handy in testing. For example, by canceling a webhook, you prevent the test accounts created during testing from
being added to CRM.

To get this behavior, cancel the webhook by raising an error for all accounts with the `test-` name prefix:

```jsonnet
function(ctx)
if std.startsWith(ctx.identity.traits.email, "test-") then
  error "cancel"
else
  {
    user_id: ctx.identity.id
  }
```

:::info

Currently, jsonnet doesn't support regular expressions. Follow this issue to see if the feature has been implemented:
[google/go-jsonnet/409](https://github.com/google/go-jsonnet/issues/409).

:::

#### Non-blocking webhooks

Sometimes you need to interact with external systems without needing their response. For example, when a user signs up, a webhook
is that adds their email address to the newsletter is triggered.

If you decide that the system response that indicates if the process was successful is not critical for your setup, make the
webhook execution non-blocking to ignore whatever response is returned.

To do that, set `response.ignore` to `true` in the webhook config:

```yaml
- hook: web_hook
  config:
    # highlight-start
    response:
      ignore: true
    # highlight-end
```

#### Flow-interrupting webhooks

If you want the result of webhook execution to have the potential of blocking a self-service user flow, use the
`can_interrupt: true` setting in the config.

The external service called in the flow decides if it allows the flow to continue, or if it interrupts the flow. For example:

- For HTTP response codes `1xx`, `2xx`, and `3xx`, the flow is not interrupted.
- For HTTP response codes `4xx`, `5xx`, the external service interrupts the flow and returns a predefined payload.

Example payload:

```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "instance_ptr": "#/traits/foo/bar", # Indicates the field where there is an error.
      "messages": [
        {
          "id": 123, # Unique numeric ID of the error that helps the frontend to interpret this message.
          "text": "field must be longer than 12 characters",
          "type": "validation",
          "context": {
            "value": "short value"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

When using an `after` registration hook, you can define the specific point in the flow where this webhook is called:

- When the webhook can interrupt the flow (`can_interrupt: true`), the logic is called before the system creates a new identity.
- When the webhook can't interrupt the flow (`can_interrupt: false`), the logic is called after the system creates a new identity.

You can call a webhook before and after the system creates an identity. To do that, define two webhooks with different
`can_interrupt` values:

```yaml
flows:
  registration:
    after:
      password:
        hooks:
          - hook: web_hook
            config:
              can_interrupt: true
          - hook: web_hook
            config:
              can_interrupt: false
```

:::tip

Flow-interrupting webhooks work best if you give users meaningful information about the status of their flow. The best place to
trigger these hooks is `after` flows.
