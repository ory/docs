# B2B Single Sign-On & SAML

:::info

Organizations are only available in Ory Network and are not supported in self-hosted Ory Kratos. If you have any questions, or if
you would like more information about transitioning to Ory Network, please don't hesitate to
[reach out](https://www.ory.sh/contact/).

Organizations are a way to group users within one project. An organization always belongs to one Ory project. Within a project, an
identity can belong to an organization or remain without an organization. Organizations contain multiple OIDC SSO connections. All
members of an organization must use one of the organization's OIDC SSO connections to log in.

An organization can have multiple domains. Registrations for email addresses with a domain that belongs to an organization must go
through one of the organization's OIDC SSO connections.

Some identity providers do not validate email domain ownership. This can lead to situations where Enterprise SSO with
Organizations is configured for a specified domain such as `@example.com`, but due to this lack of this email domain ownership
validation by the identity provider, a users with other email domains such as `@gmail.com` can still authenticate successfully via
the identity provider.

This will end up with the user being part of the configured organization in your Ory project, even if the domain does not match
any of the configured domains.

```mdx-code-block
<Mermaid

    Project -->|has many| Organization

    Users -.->|authenticate| Connection
    Project -.->|Identity pool| Users
    Connection -.- Google
    Connection -.- Okta
    Connection -.- Keycloak
`}
/>
```

Organizations require identifier-first authentication and two-step registration when using Account Experience 2.x or Ory Elements
1.x.

## Manage organizations

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs groupId="console-or-api">
<TabItem value="console" label="Ory Console">
```

To create, update, or delete organizations via the Ory Console, go to

<ConsoleLink route="project.authentication.organizations" />.

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="api" label="API">
```

Organizations can also be managed using the Ory API. To authenticate your requests, create a
[workspace API key](/concepts/personal-access-token#authorizing-ory-network-workspace-admin-apis).

All examples below use [curl](https://curl.se/) to make HTTP requests. You can use any HTTP client to make these requests.

Before copy & pasting the following examples, export your `PROJECT_ID` and `WORKSPACE_API_KEY`:

```shell
export PROJECT_ID="..."
export WORKSPACE_API_KEY="ory_wak_..."
```

#### List organizations

```shell
curl -X GET --location "https://api.console.ory.sh/projects/$PROJECT_ID/organizations" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $WORKSPACE_API_KEY"
```

#### Create an organization

```shell
curl -X POST --location "https://api.console.ory.sh/projects/$PROJECT_ID/organizations" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $WORKSPACE_API_KEY" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
           "label":  "Hello demo",
           "domains": ["test.example.com"]
         }'
```

#### Get an organization

```shell
curl -X GET --location "https://api.console.ory.sh/projects/$PROJECT_ID/organizations/$ORGANIZATION_ID" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $WORKSPACE_API_KEY"
```

#### Delete an organization

```shell
curl -X DELETE --location "https://api.console.ory.sh/projects/$PROJECT_ID/organizations/$ORGANIZATION_ID" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $WORKSPACE_API_KEY"
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

## Create SSO connections for an organization

After creating an organization, continue by adding one or more SSO OIDC connections.

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs groupId="console-or-api">
<TabItem value="console" label="Ory Console">
```

Go to <ConsoleLink route="project.authentication.organizations" /> and continue by configuring the selected organization.

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="api" label="API">
```

The SSO connections are part of the project configuration. To authenticate, use the same workspace API key as for managing
organizations. The examples use [curl](https://curl.se/) to make HTTP requests and [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) to parse
JSON response.

#### Create an SSO connection

```shell
curl -X PATCH --location "https://api.console.ory.sh/projects/$PROJECT_ID" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $WORKSPACE_API_KEY" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '[
           {
             "op": "add",
             "path": "/services/identity/config/selfservice/methods/oidc/config/providers/-",
             "value": {
               "client_id": "...",
               "client_secret": "...",
               "id": "ory-GPx1yPH4",
               "issuer_url": "https://example.org",
               "label": "My OIDC provider",
               "mapper_url": "base64://ZnVuY3Rpb24oY3R4KSBjdHg=",
               "organization_id": "6bb1c7d1-3b3e-4995-9e09-35649dc45a2b",
               "provider": "generic",
               "pkce": "auto", # or "force", "never", see note on redirect URL below
               "scope": ["openid", "offline_access", "email"]
             }
           }
         ]' \
   | jq ".project.services.identity.config.selfservice.methods.oidc.config.providers"
```

Some notes on the fields of the JSON payload:

- `client_id` and `client_secret` are the credentials of the OIDC provider.
- `id` is a unique identifier for the connection, and part of the redirect URL, and can be a random string. This is `$PROJECT_ID`
  below.
- `organization_id` is the ID of the organization to which the connection belongs, and part of the redirect URL. This is
  `$ORGANIZATION_ID` below.
- `mapper_url` is the URL to a JSONnet file that maps the OIDC provider's claims to Ory's identity schema. You can use the
  `base64` scheme to embed the JSONnet file directly in the JSON payload.
- `pkce` determines whether Ory Identities will use PKCE during the OIDC flow. See the note below and the
  [PKCE documentation](../social-signin/oidc-pkce.mdx) for details.

:::tip

The redirect URL to be set in the external OIDC provider's configuration is
`https://$PROJECT_SLUG.projects.oryapis.com/self-service/methods/oidc/organization/$ORGANIZATION_ID/callback/$PROVIDER_ID`.

If you set `pkce: force`, you must whitelist a different redirect URL with the OIDC provider:
`https://$PROJECT_SLUG.projects.oryapis.com/self-service/methods/oidc/callback`.

See the [PKCE documentation](../social-signin/oidc-pkce.mdx) for details.

#### List SSO connections

```shell
curl -X GET --location "https://api.console.ory.sh/projects/$PROJECT_ID" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $WORKSPACE_API_KEY" \
   | jq ".services.identity.config.selfservice.methods.oidc.config.providers"
```

Result:

```json
[
  {
    "client_id": "...",
    "client_secret": "...",
    "id": "ory-GPx1yPH4",
    "issuer_url": "https://example.org",
    "label": "My OIDC provider",
    "mapper_url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/bac-gcs-production/94292215dbabe405bebff988b5356663fcf5cba35b10fc6ca2cfea7bc7049e906e01d271a3daeb844203efdfbf2cff356274daa63d5afc2a379bbe93b8b40e63.jsonnet",
    "organization_id": "6bb1c7d1-3b3e-4995-9e09-35649dc45a2b",
    "provider": "generic",
    "scope": ["openid", "offline_access", "email"]
  }
]
```

#### Delete an SSO connection

To delete an organization, you need to specify the index of the connection in the `path` field. The index is the position of the
SSO connection in the list of connections.

```shell
curl -X PATCH --location "https://api.console.ory.sh/projects/$PROJECT_ID" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $WORKSPACE_API_KEY" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '[
           {
             "op": "remove",
             "path": "/services/identity/config/selfservice/methods/oidc/config/providers/0"
           }
         ]' \
   | jq ".project.services.identity.config.selfservice.methods.oidc.config.providers"
```

Note that the `organization_id` field contains the organization ID to which the connection belongs.

### See it live

After having set up everything, go to your registration page. Entering an email that ends with the organization's domain, such as
`@my.example.com` from the example above, shows a **Sign in with SSO** button instead of the password field. Clicking it will take
you to sign in with the SSO connection. The SSO connection is not visible for email addresses that are not managed by the
organization.

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

## Pre-provisioning identities in an organization

After creating an organization, you can pre-provision identities in it. This is useful when you need to create related data in
your system but need the identity to be created in Ory Network first, before the user logs in for the first time.

To achieve this, set the `organization_id` property to the ID of the created organization in the identity, either when creating
the identity, or by updating the identity's data using the Ory APIs.

## SAML

SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) is an XML-based open standard used for exchanging authentication and authorization data
between parties. The SAML integration in Ory Network uses the B2B Organization feature.

### SAML via Ory Network

This guide will walk you through the steps required to set up SAML Single Sign-On (SSO) with Ory Network.

#### Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you are on a plan that supports SAML SSO. SAML is available exclusively on select Enterprise plans.
[Contact us](https://www.ory.sh/contact/) if you need SAML support.

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs groupId="console-or-api">
<TabItem value="console" label="Ory Console">
```

1. Go to <ConsoleLink route="project.authentication.organizations" /> to create an organization.
2. Select "Add a new Enterprise SAML SSO connection" and follow the instructions to configure the SAML connection. Fill out the
   following form fields:

- **Label**: A descriptive name for the SAML connection. This will be displayed to users.
- **Data mapping**: A mapping from the SAML attributes to Ory's identity schema.
- **Raw IDP metadata XML**: The XML metadata file from your SAML Identity Provider (IdP).

3. Navigate to your login screen to test the SAML connection.

#### Create an organization

```shell
curl -X POST --location "https://api.console.ory.sh/projects/$PROJECT_ID/organizations" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $WORKSPACE_API_KEY" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
           "label":  "SAML organzation",
           "domains": ["example.com"]
         }'
```

#### Enable SAML authentication

```shell
curl -X PATCH --location "https://api.console.ory.sh/projects/$PROJECT_ID" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $WORKSPACE_API_KEY" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '[
           {
             "op": "replace",
             "path": "/services/identity/config/selfservice/methods/saml/enabled",
             "value": true
           }
         ]' \
   | jq ".project.services.identity.config.selfservice.methods.saml"
```

#### Create a SAML connection

```shell
curl -X PATCH --location "https://api.console.ory.sh/projects/$PROJECT_ID" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $WORKSPACE_API_KEY" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '[
           {
             "op": "add",
             "path": "/services/identity/config/selfservice/methods/saml/config/providers/-",
             "value": {
               "id": "some-provider-id",
               "label": "My SAML provider",
               "mapper_url": "base64://...",
               "raw_idp_metadata_xml": "base64://...",
               "organization_id": "$ORGANIZATION_ID"
             }
           }
         ]' \
   | jq ".project.services.identity.config.selfservice.methods.saml"
```

- **label**: A descriptive name for the SAML connection. This will be displayed to users.
- **mapper_url**: A mapping from the SAML attributes to Ory's identity schema.
- **raw_idp_metadata_xml**: The XML metadata file from your SAML Identity Provider (IdP).

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

The SAML application callback URL to set at our SAML Identity Provider is: `https://api.console.ory.sh/saml/api/oauth/saml`

#### Data mapping

You can configure the mapping of SAML attributes to Ory's identity schema using Jsonnet. All custom SAML attributes defined at the
Identity Provider (IdP) will be available in the `raw_claims` object within `claims`. These attributes can then be mapped to the
Ory identity schema.

:::warning

Ensure that the appropriate identity schema is created before mapping attributes. The email attribute is natively available in
`claims.email`, everything else is nested under `claims.raw_claims`.

:::

#### Example SAML data mapping

Mapping `firstName` and `lastName` from the SAML Identity Provider to the Ory identity schema (traits).

```jsonnet
local claims = std.extVar('claims');

{
  identity: {
    traits: {
      email: claims.email,
      [if std.objectHas(claims, "raw_claims") && std.objectHas(claims.raw_claims, "firstName") then "firstName" else null]: claims.raw_claims.firstName,
      [if std.objectHas(claims, "raw_claims") && std.objectHas(claims.raw_claims, "lastName") then "lastName" else null]: claims.raw_claims.lastName,
    },
  },
}
```
