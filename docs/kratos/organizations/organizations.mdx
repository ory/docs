Organizations are a way to group users within one project. An organization always belongs to one Ory project. Within a project, an
identity can belong to an organization or remain without an organization. Organizations contain multiple OIDC SSO connections. All
members of an organization must use one of the organization's OIDC SSO connections to log in.

An organization can have multiple domains. Registrations for email addresses with a domain that belongs to an organization must go
through one of the organization's OIDC SSO connections.

## Manage organizations

Organizations can be created, updated, and deleted via the HTTP REST API. The following examples show how to manage organizations.
Before you can manage organizations, you need to copy the `ory_session_ory` cookie from your browser. For detailed instructions on
using the projects API refer to the
[Manage Ory Network projects using the API ](https://www.ory.sh/projects-api-management-guide/) blogpost.

### Create an organization

```shell
# project_id = your project ID
# ory_session_cookie = the value of the ory_session_ory cookie

curl -X POST --location "https://api.console.ory.sh/projects/${project_id}/organizations" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Cookie: ory_session_ory=${ory_session_cookie}" \
    -d "{
          \"domains\": [
            \"my.example.com\"
          ],
          \"label\": \"My Organization\"
        }"

# Returns:
#   {
#     "id": "87a01675-55f4-4b4f-b702-788546536cd0",
#     "project_id": "45a22e6f-5eca-4925-bc44-4736c775e892",
#     "label": "My Organization",
#     "domains": [
#       "my.example.com"
#     ]
#   }
```

### List the project's organizations

```shell
# project_id = your project ID
# ory_session_cookie = the value of the ory_session_ory cookie

curl -X GET --location "https://api.console.ory.sh/projects/${project_id}/organizations" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Cookie: ory_session_ory=${ory_session_cookie}"

# Returns:
#   {
#     "organizations": [
#       {
#         "id": "696778f4-8975-45ad-8809-5433dc0f576e",
#         "project_id": "45a22e6f-5eca-4925-bc44-4736c775e892",
#         "label": "My Organization",
#         "domains": [
#           "my.example.com"
#         ]
#       }
#     ]
#   }
```

### Delete an organization

```shell
# organization_id = your organization ID (from a previous GET request)
# project_id = your project ID
# ory_session_cookie = the value of the ory_session_ory cookie

curl -X DELETE --location "https://api.console.ory.sh/projects/${project_id}/organizations/${organization_id}" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Cookie: ory_session_ory=${ory_session_cookie}"

# Returns an empty response on success
```

## Create SSO connections for an organization

After creating an organization, continue by adding one or more SSO OIDC connections. In the Ory Console, navigate to
[Authentication > Social Sign-In & SSO (OIDC)](https://console.ory.sh/projects/current/social-signin). From there, add a new
OpenID Connect provider. Under **Show advanced settings**, configure the organization to use for this connection.

![Configure the SSO connection in the Ory Console](configure-sso-connection.png)

Next, go to your registration page. Entering an email that ends with the organization's domain, such as `@my.example.com` from the
example above, shows a **Sign in with SSO** button instead of the password field. Clicking it will take you to sign in with the
SSO connection. The SSO connection is not visible for email addresses that are not managed by the organization.
