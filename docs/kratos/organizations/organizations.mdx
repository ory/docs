# B2B Single Sign-On & SAML

:::info

Organizations are only available in Ory Network and are not supported in self-hosted Ory Kratos. If you have any questions, or if
you would like more information about transitioning to Ory Network, please don't hesitate to
[reach out](https://www.ory.sh/contact/).

Organizations are a way to group users within one project. An organization always belongs to one Ory project. Within a project, an
identity can belong to an organization or remain without an organization. Organizations contain multiple OIDC SSO connections. All
members of an organization must use one of the organization's OIDC SSO connections to log in.

An organization can have multiple domains. Registrations for email addresses with a domain that belongs to an organization must go
through one of the organization's OIDC SSO connections.

```

## Manage organizations

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs groupId="console-or-api">
<TabItem value="console" label="Ory Console">
```

<p>
To create, update, or delete organizations via the Ory Console, go to{" "}<ConsoleLink route="project.authentication.organizations" />.
</p>
```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="api" label="API">
```

Organizations can also be managed using the Ory API. To authenticate your requests, create a
[workspace API key](/concepts/personal-access-token#authorizing-ory-network-workspace-admin-apis).

All examples below use [curl](https://curl.se/) to make HTTP requests. You can use any HTTP client to make these requests.

Before copy & pasting the following examples, export your `PROJECT_ID` and `WORKSPACE_API_KEY`:

```shell
export PROJECT_ID="..."
export WORKSPACE_API_KEY="ory_wak_..."
```

#### List organizations

```shell
curl -X GET --location "https://api.console.ory.sh/projects/$PROJECT_ID/organizations" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $WORKSPACE_API_KEY"
```

#### Create an organization

```shell
curl -X POST --location "https://api.console.ory.sh/projects/$PROJECT_ID/organizations" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $WORKSPACE_API_KEY" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
           "label":  "Hello demo",
           "domains": ["test.example.com"]
         }'
```

#### Get an organization

```shell
curl -X GET --location "https://api.console.ory.sh/projects/$PROJECT_ID/organizations/$ORGANIZATION_ID" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $WORKSPACE_API_KEY"
```

#### Delete an organization

```shell
curl -X DELETE --location "https://api.console.ory.sh/projects/$PROJECT_ID/organizations/$ORGANIZATION_ID" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $WORKSPACE_API_KEY"
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

## Create SSO connections for an organization

After creating an organization, continue by adding one or more SSO OIDC connections.

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs groupId="console-or-api">
<TabItem value="console" label="Ory Console">
```

Go to <ConsoleLink route="project.authentication.organizations" /> and continue by configuring the selected organization.

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="api" label="API">
```

The SSO connections are part of the project configuration. To authenticate, use the same workspace API key as for managing
organizations. The examples use [curl](https://curl.se/) to make HTTP requests and [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) to parse
JSON response.

#### Create an SSO connection

```shell
curl -X PATCH --location "https://api.console.ory.sh/projects/$PROJECT_ID" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $WORKSPACE_API_KEY" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '[
           {
             "op": "add",
             "path": "/services/identity/config/selfservice/methods/oidc/config/providers/-",
             "value": {
               "client_id": "...",
               "client_secret": "...",
               "id": "ory-GPx1yPH4",
               "issuer_url": "https://example.org",
               "label": "My OIDC provider",
               "mapper_url": "base64://ZnVuY3Rpb24oY3R4KSBjdHg=",
               "organization_id": "6bb1c7d1-3b3e-4995-9e09-35649dc45a2b",
               "provider": "generic",
               "pkce": "auto", # or "force", "never", see note on redirect URL below
               "scope": ["openid", "offline_access", "email"]
             }
           }
         ]' \
   | jq ".project.services.identity.config.selfservice.methods.oidc.config.providers"
```

Some notes on the fields of the JSON payload:

- `client_id` and `client_secret` are the credentials of the OIDC provider.
- `id` is a unique identifier for the connection, and part of the redirect URL, and can be a random string. This is `$PROJECT_ID`
  below.
- `organization_id` is the ID of the organization to which the connection belongs, and part of the redirect URL. This is
  `$ORGANIZATION_ID` below.
- `mapper_url` is the URL to a JSONnet file that maps the OIDC provider's claims to Ory's identity schema. You can use the
  `base64` scheme to embed the JSONnet file directly in the JSON payload.
- `pkce` determines whether Ory Identities will use PKCE during the OIDC flow. See the note below and the
  [PKCE documentation](../social-signin/oidc-pkce.mdx) for details.

:::tip

The redirect URL to be set in the external OIDC provider's configuration is
`https://$PROJECT_SLUG.projects.oryapis.com/self-service/methods/oidc/organization/$ORGANIZATION_ID/callback/$PROVIDER_ID`.

If you set `pkce: force`, you must whitelist a different redirect URL with the OIDC provider:
`https://$PROJECT_SLUG.projects.oryapis.com/self-service/methods/oidc/callback`.

See the [PKCE documentation](../social-signin/oidc-pkce.mdx) for details.

#### List SSO connections

```shell
curl -X GET --location "https://api.console.ory.sh/projects/$PROJECT_ID" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $WORKSPACE_API_KEY" \
   | jq ".services.identity.config.selfservice.methods.oidc.config.providers"
```

Result:

```json
[
  {
    "client_id": "...",
    "client_secret": "...",
    "id": "ory-GPx1yPH4",
    "issuer_url": "https://example.org",
    "label": "My OIDC provider",
    "mapper_url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/bac-gcs-production/94292215dbabe405bebff988b5356663fcf5cba35b10fc6ca2cfea7bc7049e906e01d271a3daeb844203efdfbf2cff356274daa63d5afc2a379bbe93b8b40e63.jsonnet",
    "organization_id": "6bb1c7d1-3b3e-4995-9e09-35649dc45a2b",
    "provider": "generic",
    "scope": ["openid", "offline_access", "email"]
  }
]
```

#### Delete an SSO connection

To delete an organization, you need to specify the index of the connection in the `path` field. The index is the position of the
SSO connection in the list of connections.

```shell
curl -X PATCH --location "https://api.console.ory.sh/projects/$PROJECT_ID" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $WORKSPACE_API_KEY" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '[
           {
             "op": "remove",
             "path": "/services/identity/config/selfservice/methods/oidc/config/providers/0"
           }
         ]' \
   | jq ".project.services.identity.config.selfservice.methods.oidc.config.providers"
```

Note that the `organization_id` field contains the organization ID to which the connection belongs.

### See it live

After having set up everything, go to your registration page. Entering an email that ends with the organization's domain, such as
`@my.example.com` from the example above, shows a **Sign in with SSO** button instead of the password field. Clicking it will take
you to sign in with the SSO connection. The SSO connection is not visible for email addresses that are not managed by the
organization.

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

## SAML

SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) is an XML-based open standard used for exchanging authentication and authorization data
between parties.  
The SAML integration in Ory Network uses the B2B Organization feature.

This guide will walk you through the steps required to set up SAML Single Sign-On (SSO) with Ory Network using BoxyHQ as your SAML
provider.

### Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have the following:

- Access to [Ory Network](https://console.ory.sh/)
- An active account with [BoxyHQ](https://app.eu.boxyhq.com/auth/join)
- [Ory CLI](../../guides/cli/installation)

:::note

If you need help with the integration or have any questions, please open a [support ticket](https://console.ory.sh/support) or
reach out to support@ory.sh.

:::

### Configuration

To set up the integration, you'll need to get your Ory Network session token:

- [Install the Ory CLI](../../guides/cli/installation) on your system.
- Run `ory auth` to sign into your Ory Network account.
- Locate the session token in the `.ory-cloud.json` file in your home folder. This token starts with the prefix `ory_st`. You can
  use `cat ~/.ory-cloud.json | grep 'ory_st'` to find it.

You'll also need your Ory Project ID. You can find this in your
[Ory Network settings](https://console.ory.sh/projects/current/settings).

Next, you'll configure the session token and Project ID in BoxyHQ.

Follow these steps:

- Log into your [BoxyHQ account](https://app.boxyhq.com/).
- Create a new Product if you haven't already.
- Navigate to Settings > Ory Integration.
- Paste your session token and Project ID into the respective input fields and save the configuration.

Once configured, the integration between BoxyHQ and Ory Network will automatically set up a new Organization and a generic OIDC
connection whenever you create a new SSO connection on BoxyHQ. All user management will then flow through Ory Network.

To verify the integration, navigate to your Ory Account Experience UI and enter an email associated with the domain you
configured. If successful, the "Sign in with SSO" button should appear.
