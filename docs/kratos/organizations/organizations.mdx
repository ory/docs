Organizations are only available in Ory Network and are not supported in self-hosted Ory Kratos. If you have any questions, or if
you would like more information about transitioning to Ory Network, please don't hesitate to
[reach out](https://www.ory.sh/contact/).

Organizations are a way to group users within one project. An organization always belongs to one Ory project. Within a project, an
identity can belong to an organization or remain without an organization. Organizations contain multiple OIDC SSO connections. All
members of an organization must use one of the organization's OIDC SSO connections to log in.

An organization can have multiple domains. Registrations for email addresses with a domain that belongs to an organization must go
through one of the organization's OIDC SSO connections.

```

## Manage organizations

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs groupId="console-or-api">
<TabItem value="console" label="Ory Console">
```

<p>
To create, update, or delete organizations via the Ory Console, go to{" "}<ConsoleLink route="project.authentication.organizations" />.
</p>
```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="api" label="API">
```

Organizations can also be managed using the Ory API. To authenticate your requests, create a
[workspace API key](/concepts/personal-access-token#authorizing-ory-network-workspace-admin-apis).

All examples below use [curl](https://curl.se/) to make HTTP requests. You can use any HTTP client to make these requests.

Before copy & pasting the following examples, export your `PROJECT_ID` and `WORKSPACE_API_KEY`:

```shell
export PROJECT_ID="..."
export WORKSPACE_API_KEY="ory_wak_..."
```

#### List organizations

```shell
curl -X GET --location "https://api.console.ory.sh/projects/$PROJECT_ID/organizations" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $WORKSPACE_API_KEY"
```

#### Create an organization

```shell
curl -X POST --location "https://api.console.ory.sh/projects/$PROJECT_ID/organizations" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $WORKSPACE_API_KEY" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
           "label":  "Hello demo",
           "domains": ["test.example.com"]
         }'
```

#### Get an organization

```shell
curl -X GET --location "https://api.console.ory.sh/projects/$PROJECT_ID/organizations/$ORGANIZATION_ID" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $WORKSPACE_API_KEY"
```

#### Delete an organization

```shell
curl -X DELETE --location "https://api.console.ory.sh/projects/$PROJECT_ID/organizations/$ORGANIZATION_ID" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $WORKSPACE_API_KEY"
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

## Create SSO connections for an organization

After creating an organization, continue by adding one or more SSO OIDC connections.

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs groupId="console-or-api">
<TabItem value="console" label="Ory Console">
```

Go to <ConsoleLink route="project.authentication.organizations" /> and continue by configuring the selected organization.

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="api" label="API">
```

The SSO connections are part of the project configuration. To authenticate, use the same workspace API key as for managing
organizations. The examples use [curl](https://curl.se/) to make HTTP requests and [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) to parse
JSON response.

#### Create an SSO connection

```shell
curl -X PATCH --location "https://api.console.ory.sh/projects/$PROJECT_ID" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $WORKSPACE_API_KEY" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '[
           {
             "op": "add",
             "path": "/services/identity/config/selfservice/methods/oidc/config/providers/-",
             "value": {
               "client_id": "...",
               "client_secret": "...",
               "id": "ory-GPx1yPH4",
               "issuer_url": "https://example.org",
               "label": "My OIDC provider",
               "mapper_url": "base64://ZnVuY3Rpb24oY3R4KSBjdHg=",
               "organization_id": "6bb1c7d1-3b3e-4995-9e09-35649dc45a2b",
               "provider": "generic",
               "scope": ["openid", "offline_access", "email"]
             }
           }
         ]' \
   | jq ".project.services.identity.config.selfservice.methods.oidc.config.providers"
```

Some notes on the fields of the JSON payload:

- `client_id` and `client_secret` are the credentials of the OIDC provider.
- `id` is a unique identifier for the connection, and part of the redirect URL, and can be a random string. This is `$PROJECT_ID`
  below.
- `organization_id` is the ID of the organization to which the connection belongs, and part of the redirect URL. This is
  `$ORGANIZATION_ID` below.
- `mapper_url` is the URL to a JSONnet file that maps the OIDC provider's claims to Ory's identity schema. You can use the
  `base64` scheme to embed the JSONnet file directly in the JSON payload.

The redirect URL to be set in the external OIDC provider's configuration is
`https://$PROJECT_SLUG.projects.oryapis.com/self-service/methods/oidc/organization/$ORGANIZATION_ID/callback/$PROVIDER_ID`.

#### List SSO connections

```shell
curl -X GET --location "https://api.console.ory.sh/projects/$PROJECT_ID" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $WORKSPACE_API_KEY" \
   | jq ".services.identity.config.selfservice.methods.oidc.config.providers"
```

Result:

```json
[
  {
    "client_id": "...",
    "client_secret": "...",
    "id": "ory-GPx1yPH4",
    "issuer_url": "https://example.org",
    "label": "My OIDC provider",
    "mapper_url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/bac-gcs-production/94292215dbabe405bebff988b5356663fcf5cba35b10fc6ca2cfea7bc7049e906e01d271a3daeb844203efdfbf2cff356274daa63d5afc2a379bbe93b8b40e63.jsonnet",
    "organization_id": "6bb1c7d1-3b3e-4995-9e09-35649dc45a2b",
    "provider": "generic",
    "scope": ["openid", "offline_access", "email"]
  }
]
```

#### Delete an SSO connection

To delete an organization, you need to specify the index of the connection in the `path` field. The index is the position of the
SSO connection in the list of connections.

```shell
curl -X PATCH --location "https://api.console.ory.sh/projects/$PROJECT_ID" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $WORKSPACE_API_KEY" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '[
           {
             "op": "remove",
             "path": "/services/identity/config/selfservice/methods/oidc/config/providers/0"
           }
         ]' \
   | jq ".project.services.identity.config.selfservice.methods.oidc.config.providers"
```

Note that the `organization_id` field contains the organization ID to which the connection belongs.

## See it live

After having set up everything, go to your registration page. Entering an email that ends with the organization's domain, such as
`@my.example.com` from the example above, shows a **Sign in with SSO** button instead of the password field. Clicking it will take
you to sign in with the SSO connection. The SSO connection is not visible for email addresses that are not managed by the
organization.
