For sending SMS Ory Identities uses an external SMS gateway, which must have HTTP API (such as Twilio, your local SMS sender, or
your own microservice). Request method, headers, body, and content-type are fully configurable using options below.

## Configuration

Default configuration of Ory Identities doesn't include sending SMS. To enable it you need to set "enabled" flag to true, sender
URL, authorization (if needed) and request body format.

### Sender phone number

SMS message will come to the recipient from this phone number. Depending on your SMS sender settings you can use letters here (for
example "Your Org Name"). Default value is equal to "Ory Identities".

```yaml title="config.yml"
courier:
  sms:
    from: "+12065550110"
```

### Request configuration

```yaml title="config.yml"
courier:
  sms:
    request_config:
      url: https://api.twilio.com/2010-04-01/Accounts/YourAccountID/Messages.json
      method: POST
      body: file://./twilio.request.jsonnet
      header:
        "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
      auth:
        type: basic_auth
        config:
          user: YourUsername
          password: YourPass
```

The configuration consists of:

- `url` - the URL, which should be called (mandatory). It needs to be absolute, start with http:// or https:// scheme, and include
  path part - for example "https://api.sender.com/v1/message".
- `method` - the HTTP method (GET, POST, ...) (mandatory)
- `body` - URI of a JsonNet template, used to render the payload to send (optional). Use a `file://path/to/body.jsonnet` URL for
  referring to local files. This property is ignored for HTTP `method`s, which don't support sending of HTTP body payloads
  (TRACE).
- `auth` - configuration of authentication and authorization mechanisms to be used by request

Courier binds the `from`, `to`, and `body` variables into the JsonNet template. These variables are available through a `ctx`
object. For example to create a body looking like `{ to: "<some-number>" }` to be sent to the SMS provider endpoint, the jsonnet
template would look like this:

```jsonnet
function(ctx) {
  from: ctx.from,
  to: ctx.to,
  body: ctx.body
}
```

### Authentication and Authorization

For `auth` following mechanisms are supported:

- Authentication via an Api Key. Type must be set to `api_key`.
- Authentication via Basic Authentication. Type must be set to `basic_auth`.

For `api_key` the config looks as follows:

```yaml
name: Some-Name
value: The-Value-of-My-Key
in: header # alternatively cookie
```

All properties are mandatory.

For `basic_auth` the config looks as follows:

```yaml
user: My-User
password: My-Pass-Value
```

All properties are mandatory.
