title: Create and Invite Identities
---

This document walks you through the administrative identity management in Ory.
You should already be familiar with the
[Identity Schema](../concepts/identity-schema.mdx) before reading this guide.

There are three principal flows supported for creating identities as an
administrator:

1. Create users;
1. Invite users - e.g. inviting a new employee to your organization IT;
1. Importing existing users - e.g. when migrating from another system to Ory
   Kratos.

## Create an Identity

The goal of this flow is to create an identity and provide the end-user with a
way of signing into the identity (account) and setting their password (or any
other type of credential) for future logins. To achieve this, first create the
identity and set its traits and schema:

````mdx-code-block
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs'
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem'
import { getSdkUrl } from '@site/src/hooks'
import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock'
import SelfHostedKratos from '@site/src/components/SelfHostedKratos'

<Tabs
  defaultValue="cloud"
  values={[
    {label: 'Ory Cloud', value: 'cloud'},
    {label: 'Self-Hosted Ory Kratos', value: 'kratos'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="cloud">

```shell
curl --request POST -sL \\
  --header "Authorization: Bearer ory_pat_xRKLsFEOUFQFVBjd6o3FQDifaLYhabGd" \\
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \\
  --data '{
  "schema_id": "preset://email",
  "traits": {
    "email": "docs@example.org"
  }
}' https://playground.projects.oryapis.com/api/kratos/admin/identities
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="kratos">
    <SelfHostedKratos/>
    <p>And use it to create an identity:</p>

```shell
curl --request POST -sL \\
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \\
  --data '{
  "schema_id": "preset://email",
  "traits": {
    "email": "docs@example.org"
  }
}' http://127.0.0.1:4434/identities
```

 </TabItem>
</Tabs>
````

The server responds with something similar to:

```json
{
  "id": "e01b5f2f-6afc-4194-8578-4cebcf69a4d5",
  "schema_id": "preset://email",
  "schema_url": "https://playground.projects.oryapis.com/api/kratos/public/schemas/cHJlc2V0Oi8vZW1haWw",
  "state": "active",
  "state_changed_at": "2022-02-24T13:38:05.27510048Z",
  "traits": {
    "email": "docs@example.org"
  },
  "verifiable_addresses": [
    {
      "id": "c6cea2a7-f419-42fe-a610-456bea02aab5",
      "value": "docs@example.org",
      "verified": false,
      "via": "email",
      "status": "pending",
      "created_at": "2022-02-24T13:38:05.28581Z",
      "updated_at": "2022-02-24T13:38:05.28581Z"
    }
  ],
  "recovery_addresses": [
    {
      "id": "21ff90e1-a9a9-491e-8194-774172420989",
      "value": "docs@example.org",
      "via": "email",
      "created_at": "2022-02-24T13:38:05.29565Z",
      "updated_at": "2022-02-24T13:38:05.29565Z"
    }
  ],
  "created_at": "2022-02-24T13:38:05.27892Z",
  "updated_at": "2022-02-24T13:38:05.27892Z"
}
```

Keep in mind that you can change the `schema_id` to reflect the schema you want
to use for this identity. Similarly, the trait key/values depend on your schema
as well. The command shown does not create a password for the identity or any
other type of credential.

## Invite Identity

While there is no feature called "user invite", you can initiate account
recovery as an administrator which is quite similar to a user invite feature as
it allows the user to set their password (or any other credential) and sign in
without further intervention.
