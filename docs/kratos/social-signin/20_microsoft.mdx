## Configuration in Ory Console

Follow these steps to add Microsoft as a social sign-in provider for your project using the Ory Console.

1. Sign in to Ory Console and select [**Social Sign-in**](https://console.ory.sh/projects/current/social-signin).
2. Click the switch next to the Microsoft logo to start the configuration.
3. Copy the Redirect URI from Ory and save it for later use.
4. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) → **Azure Active Directory**.
5. From **Overview**, select **Manage tenants** from the top navigation. Choose the desired tenant or create a new one.
6. Return to **Overview**, open the **App registration** dropdown menu and click **App registration**.
7. Register a new application:

   - Define the app display name
   - Select the supported account types
   - Select the appropriate application type using the dropdown menu
   - Provide the Redirect URI copied from the Ory Console

8. Copy the **Application (client) ID** from Azure and paste it into the corresponding field in the Ory Console.
9. In Azure, click the **Client credentials** link and create a new client secret.
10. Copy the **Value** of the client secret and paste it into the corresponding field in the Ory Console.
11. Copy the **Directory (tenant) ID** from Azure and paste it into the corresponding field in the Ory Console.
12. Click **Save Configuration** to enable Microsoft as a social sign-in provider.

:::note

These steps cover the basic configuration of a social sign-in provider integration. At this point, the user experience is
incomplete. To complete the configuration and ensure a smooth and secure user experience, configure the [scopes](#scopes) and
[data mapping](#data-mapping) as described in the next section.

:::

### Additional configuration

When adding a social sign-in provider, you can customize the integration by defining the OAuth scopes Ory requests from the
provider and by setting up custom data mappings.

#### Scopes

The Scopes section allows you to define the OAuth scopes Ory requests from the sign-in provider. Defining scopes allows you to
interact with the provider's APIs on behalf of the user, or to access additional user data, which is exposed as claims for data
mapping.

For Microsoft, add the `email` and `profile` scopes for a basic setup.

#### Data mapping

The **Data mapping** section allows you to map the data returned by the sign-in provider to traits as defined in the identity
schema.

To define the mapping, create a Jsonnet code snippet. Read [this document](./data-mapping) to learn more about Jsonnet data
mapping.

```jsonnet
local claims = std.extVar('claims');
{
  identity: {
    traits: {
      // Allowing unverified email addresses enables account
      // enumeration attacks,  if the value is used for
      // verification or as a password login identifier.
      //
      // If connecting only to your organization (one tenant), claims.email is safe to use
      // if you haven't actively disabled e-mail verification during sign-up.
      //
      // The email might be empty if the account isn't linked to an email address.
      // For a human readable identifier, consider using the "preferred_username" claim.
      [if 'email' in claims then 'email' else null]: claims.email,
    },
  },
}
```

```mdx-code-block
import JsonnetWarning from '../../_common/jsonnetwarning.mdx'

<JsonnetWarning format="Jsonnet code snippets" use="data mapping" />
```

#### Selecting a Tenant

When you add Microsoft as a social sign-in provider, you can define which user groups can sign in and sign up with Microsoft by
setting a specific value of the **Tenant** field:

1. To authenticate users that belong to a single, specific organization (Azure Active Directory), set the value to **Directory
   (tenant) ID** or the organization's domain, for example, `example.onmicrosoft.com`.

2. To authenticate users with Microsoft accounts that are not limited to a specific organization, set **Tenant** value to:

   - `organizations` to allow users with work or school accounts
   - `consumers` to allow users with personal accounts
   - `common` to allow both kinds of accounts

:::info

To allow sign-in and sign-up for users with Microsoft accounts that don't belong to any organization (Azure Active Directory), you
must adjust the Azure application configuration by editing the
[Manifest](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/reference-app-manifest).

## Configuration using the Ory CLI

Follow these steps to add Microsoft as a social sign-in provider to your project using the Ory CLI:

1. [Create an Azure AD Application and Tenant](#configuration-in-ory-cloud-console).
2. Create a [Jsonnet code snippet](#data-mapping) to map the desired claims to the Ory Identity schema.
3. Encode the Jsonnet snippet with [Base64](https://www.base64encode.org/) or host it under an URL accessible to Ory Network.
4. Download the Ory Identities config from your project and save it to a file:

   ```shell
   ## List all available projects
   ory list projects

   ## Get config
   ory get identity-config <project-id> --format yaml > identity-config.yaml
   ```

5. Add the social sign-in provider configuration to the downloaded config. Add the Jsonnet snippet with mappings as a Base64
   string or provide an URL to the file.

   ```yaml
   selfservice:
     methods:
       oidc:
         config:
           providers:
             - id: microsoft # this is `<provider-id>` in the Authorization callback URL. DO NOT CHANGE IT ONCE SET!
               provider: microsoft
               client_id: .... # This is the the Application (client) ID from the App Registration
               client_secret: .... # This is the generated Secret value from the App Registration
               microsoft_tenant: .... # This allows you to select the tenant.
               mapper_url: "base64://<YOUR_BASE64_ENCODED_JSONNET_HERE>"
               # Alternatively, use an URL:
               # mapper_url: https://storage.googleapis.com/abc-cde-prd/9cac9717f007808bf17f22ce7f4295c739604b183f05ac4afb4
               scope:
                 - profile
                 - email
         enabled: true
   ```

6. Update the Ory Identities (Ory Kratos) configuration using the file you worked with:

   ```shell
   ory update identity-config <project-id> --file updated_config.yaml
   ```

## Configuration for self-hosted instances

Follow these steps to add Microsoft as a social sign-in provider when self-hosting Ory Kratos:

1. [Create an Azure AD Application and Tenant](#configuration-in-ory-cloud-console).
2. Set the redirect URI to URL that follows this pattern:

   ```shell
   http(s)://<domain-of-ory-kratos>:<public-port>/self-service/methods/oidc/callback/<social-signin-provider-id>
   ```

3. Create a [Jsonnet code snippet](#data-mapping) to map the desired claims to the Ory Identity schema.
4. Encode the Jsonnet snippet with [Base64](https://www.base64encode.org/) or store it in a location available to your Ory Kratos
   instance.
5. Add the [social sign-in provider configuration](#configuration-with-ory-cli) to the Ory Kratos configuration. Add the Jsonnet
   snippet with mappings as a Base64 string or provide a path or an URL of the file.

```mdx-code-block
import ConfigAsEnv from '../_common/config_as_env.mdx'

<ConfigAsEnv />
```

### Choosing source of subject identifier

By default, Microsoft uses the identifier taken from the `sub` field of OIDC `id_token`. The same identifier is also returned by
the standard OIDC `/userinfo` endpoint.

However, some systems use the `id` field returned by the `https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me` endpoint as a subject identifier.
To make migrating such systems to the Ory Identity Service (Ory Kratos) easier, you can use the identifier obtained from the `me`
endpoint.

To do that, add the `subject_source` field set to `me` to the social sign-in provider config of your Ory Kratos instance.

```yaml title=kratos-config.yaml
  providers:
  - id: microsoft # this is `<provider-id>` in the Authorization callback URL. DO NOT CHANGE IT ONCE SET!
    provider: microsoft
    client_id: .... # This is the the Application (client) ID from the App Registration
    client_secret: .... # This is the generated Secret value from the App Registration
    microsoft_tenant: .... # This allows you to select the tenant.
    // highlight-start
    subject_source: me
    # or
    # subject_source: userinfo
    scope:
      - https://graph.microsoft.com/User.Read # Required when 'subject_source: me'.
    // highlight-end
    mapper_url: 'base64://<YOUR_BASE64_ENCODED_JSONNET_HERE>'
    scope:
    - profile
    - email
```

## Prevent having to log in after sign-up

```mdx-code-block
import OidcSessionHook from '../_common/oidc_session_hook.mdx'

<OidcSessionHook />
```
