Follow these steps to add Discord as a social sign-in provider to your project using the Ory Console:

1. Sign in to Ory Console and select [**Social Sign-in**](https://console.ory.sh/projects/current/social-signin).
2. Click the switch next to the Discord logo to start the configuration.
3. Copy the Redirect URI and save it for later use.
4. [Create a Discord OAuth2 application](https://discord.com/developers/applications) by clicking the **New Application** button.
5. After creating the application, navigate to the **OAuth2 | General** section of the registered application in Discord
   and copy the following data to the corresponding fields in the form in the Ory Console:
    - **CLIENT ID**
    - **CLIENT SECRET**
6. From the **OAuth2 &rarr; General** section in Discord,
   add the saved Redirect URI from Ory to the **Redirects** of the registered application.
7. In the **Scopes** field of the form in the Ory Console, add the following scopes:
    - `identify`
    - `email`
8. In the **Data Mapping** field of the form in the Ory Console, add the following Jsonnet code snippet,
   which maps the desired claims to the Ory Identity schema:

   ```jsonnet
   local claims = {
     email_verified: false,
   } + std.extVar('claims');

   {
     identity: {
       traits: {
         // Allowing unverified email addresses enables account
         // enumeration attacks,  if the value is used for
         // verification or as a password login identifier.
         //
         // Therefore we only return the email if it (a) exists and (b) is marked verified
         // by Discord.
         [if 'email' in claims && claims.email_verified then 'email' else null]: claims.email,
       },
     },
   }
   ```

   ```mdx-code-block
   <JsonnetWarning format="Jsonnet code snippets" use="data mapping" />
   ```

9. Click **Save Configuration**.

Follow these steps to add Discord as a social sign-in provider to your project using the Ory CLI:

1. [Create a Discord OAuth2 application](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2).
2. In the created app, set the redirect URI to:

   ```shell
   https://$project_slug.projects.oryapis.com/self-service/methods/oidc/callback/discord
   ```

3. Create a Jsonnet code snippet to map the desired claims to the Ory Identity schema.

   ```jsonnet
   local claims = {
     email_verified: false,
   } + std.extVar('claims');

   {
     identity: {
       traits: {
         // Allowing unverified email addresses enables account
         // enumeration attacks,  if the value is used for
         // verification or as a password login identifier.
         //
         // Therefore we only return the email if it (a) exists and (b) is marked verified
         // by Discord.
         [if 'email' in claims && claims.email_verified then 'email' else null]: claims.email,
       },
     },
   }
   ```

   :::info

   Discord doesn't implement OpenID Connect. Ory makes a request to
   [Discord's User API](https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/user#get-current-user) and adds the data to
   `std.extVar('claims')`. Not all fields are supported. Check the list of supported fields
   [in the source code](https://github.com/ory/kratos/blob/v0.5.1-alpha.1/selfservice/strategy/oidc/provider_discord.go#L81-L91).

   The `identify` scope adds these fields:

   ```text
   iss                 # always https://discord.com/api/v6/oauth2/
   sub                 # numeric discord user id
   name                # username + # + discriminator
   nickname            # username
   preferred_username  # username
   picture             # avatar url
   locale              # user locale
   ```

   The `email` scope adds these fields:

   ```text
   email               # user email
   email_verified      # whether email is verified
   ```

   :::

   ```mdx-code-block
   <JsonnetWarning format="Jsonnet code snippets" use="data mapping" />
   ```

4. Encode the Jsonnet snippet with [Base64](https://www.base64encode.org/) or host it under an URL accessible to Ory Network.

   ```shell
   cat your-data-mapping.jsonnet | base64
   ```

5. Download the Ory Identities config from your project and save it to a file:

   ```shell
   ## List all available projects
   ory list projects

   ## Get config
   ory get identity-config {project-id} --format yaml > identity-config.yaml
   ```

6. Add the social sign-in provider configuration to the downloaded config. Add the Jsonnet snippet with mappings as a Base64
   string or provide an URL to the file.

   ```yaml
   selfservice:
     methods:
       oidc:
         config:
           providers:
             - id: discord # this is `<provider-id>` in the Authorization callback URL. DO NOT CHANGE IT ONCE SET!
               provider: discord
               client_id: .... # Replace this with the OAuth2 Client ID provided by Discord
               client_secret: .... # Replace this with the OAuth2 Client Secret provided by Discord
               mapper_url: "base64://{YOUR_BASE64_ENCODED_JSONNET_HERE}"
               # Alternatively, use an URL:
               # mapper_url: https://storage.googleapis.com/abc-cde-prd/9cac9717f007808bf17f22ce7f4295c739604b183f05ac4afb4
               scope:
                 - identify
                 - email
         enabled: true
   ```

7. Update the Ory Identities configuration using the file you worked with:

   ```shell
   ory update identity-config {project-id} --file identity-config.yaml
   ```
