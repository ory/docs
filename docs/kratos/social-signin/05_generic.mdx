# Generic provider

The "Generic Provider" option allows you to add any OpenID Connect-certified provider that doesn't require custom API calls to get
the required user information. To add a social sign-in provider, you need these details:

- Client ID
- Client Secret
- Issuer URL - OpenID Connect server URL used by the provider to issue tokens

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="console" label="Ory Console" default>

Follow these steps to add a generic, OIDC-certified social sign-in provider to your project using the Ory Console:

1. Go to <ConsoleLink route="project.socialSignIn" />.
2. Click the **Add A Generic Provider** button.
3. Define the **Provider name**. This name is used for identification purposes only.
4. Paste the configuration details obtained from your social sign-in provider into the corresponding fields in the Console:
   - Client ID
   - Client Secret
   - Issuer URL
5. Copy the Redirect URI from the Console and add it to your provider's configuration.
6. Click **Save Configuration** to finish.

:::note

These steps cover the basic configuration of a social sign-in provider integration. At this point, the user experience is
incomplete. To complete the configuration and ensure a smooth and secure user experience, configure the [scopes](#scopes) and
[data mapping](#data-mapping) as described in the next section.

Follow these steps to add a generic provider as a social sign-in provider to your project using the Ory CLI:

1. Create a client at your generic provider to get a Client ID and Client Secret.
2. Create a [Jsonnet code snippet](#data-mapping) to map the desired claims to the Ory Identity schema.
3. Encode the Jsonnet snippet with [Base64](https://www.base64encode.org/) or host it under an URL accessible to Ory Network.
4. Download the Ory Identities config from your project and save it to a file:

   ```shell
   ## List all available projects
   ory list projects

   ## Get config
   ory get identity-config {project-id} --format yaml > identity-config.yaml
   ```

5. Add the social sign-in provider configuration to the downloaded config. Add the Jsonnet snippet with mappings as a Base64
   string or provide an URL to the file.

   ```yaml
   selfservice:
     methods:
       oidc:
         config:
           providers:
             - id: generic # this is `<provider-id>` in the Authorization callback URL. DO NOT CHANGE IT ONCE SET!
               provider: generic
               client_id: .... # Replace this with the Client ID
               client_secret: .... # Replace this with the Client secret
               issuer_url: https://accounts.google.com # Replace this with the providers issuer URL
               mapper_url: "base64://{YOUR_BASE64_ENCODED_JSONNET_HERE}"
               # Alternatively, use an URL:
               # mapper_url: https://storage.googleapis.com/abc-cde-prd/9cac9717f007808bf17f22ce7f4295c739604b183f05ac4afb4
               scope:
                 - email
               # supported scopes can be found in your providers dev docs
               claims_source: id_token  # set to "userinfo" to read the claims from the UserInfo endpoint
         enabled: true
   ```

6. Update the Ory Identities configuration using the file you worked with:

   ```shell
   ory update identity-config {project-id} --file identity-config.yaml
   ```

## Additional configuration

When adding a generic social sign-in provider, you can customize the integration by defining the OAuth scopes Ory requests from
the provider and by setting up custom data mappings.

### Scopes

The Scopes section allows you to define the OAuth scopes Ory requests from the sign-in provider. Defining scopes allows you to
interact with the provider's APIs on behalf of the user, or to access additional user data, which is exposed as claims for data
mapping.

### Data mapping

The **Data mapping** section allows you to map the claims returned by the sign-in provider to traits as defined in the identity
schema.

:::note

For generic providers with `claims_source=userinfo`, the issuer claim will be ignored if the userinfo response is not signed. This
behavior aligns with the OpenID Connect specification.

:::

To define the mapping, create a Jsonnet code snippet. Read [this document](./data-mapping) to learn more about Jsonnet data
mapping.

```mdx-code-block
import JsonnetWarning from '../../_common/jsonnetwarning.mdx'

<JsonnetWarning format="Jsonnet code snippets" use="data mapping" />
```

### Claims source

The claims that the sign-in provider supplies can either be read from the
[identity token](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#IDToken) or from the
[UserInfo](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#UserInfo) endpoint. The default behaviour is to use the identity
token that was supplied through the provider's token endpoint.

To call the UserInfo endpoint (as discovered through the provider's `.well-known/openid-configuration` URL), set the
`claims_source` key to `userinfo`.

```yaml
selfservice:
  methods:
    oidc:
      config:
        providers:
          - id: generic # this is `<provider-id>` in the Authorization callback URL. DO NOT CHANGE IT ONCE SET!
            provider: generic
            claims_source: userinfo # default: "id_token"
            # ...
```
