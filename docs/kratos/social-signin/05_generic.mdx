The Generic Provider option allows you to add any OpenID Connect Certified provider that doesn't require custom API calls to get
the required user information.

[Ory OAuth2 & OpenID Connect](https://www.ory.sh/hydra) is such a provider.

Do you want to see your preferred social sign-in provider get a dedicated integration flow? Let us know by filling out
[this survey](https://share-eu1.hsforms.com/1-ARyzi8nSuCYQ9Ci2i18wgextgn)!

:::

To add a social sign-in provider, you need these details:

- Client ID
- Client Secret
- Issuer URL - OpenID Connect server URL used by the provider to issue tokens

## Configuration in Ory Console

To add a Generic Provider, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to Ory Console and select [**Social Sign-in**](https://console.ory.sh/projects/current/social-signin).
2. Click the **Add A Generic Provider** button.
3. Define the **Provider name**. This name is used for identification purposes only.
4. Paste the configuration details obtained from your social sign-in provider into the corresponding fields in the Console:
   - Client ID
   - Client Secret
   - Issuer URL
5. Copy the Redirect URI from the Console and add it to your provider's configuration.
6. Click **Save Configuration** to finish.

:::note

These steps cover the basic configuration of a social sign-in provider integration. At this point, the user experience is
incomplete. To complete the configuration and ensure a smooth and secure user experience, configure the [scopes](#scopes) and
[data mapping](#data-mapping) as described in the next section.

:::

### Additional configuration

When adding a generic social sign-in provider, you can customize the integration by defining the OAuth scopes Ory requests from
the provider and by setting up custom data mappings.

#### Scopes

The Scopes section allows you to define the OAuth scopes Ory requests from the sign-in provider. Defining scopes allows you to
interact with the provider's APIs on behalf of the user, or to access additional user data, which is exposed as claims for data
mapping.

#### Data mapping

The **Data mapping** section allows you to map the data returned by the sign-in provider to traits as defined in the identity
schema.

To define the mapping, create a Jsonnet code snippet. Read [this document](./data-mapping) to learn more about Jsonnet data
mapping.

```mdx-code-block
import JsonnetWarning from '../../_common/jsonnetwarning.mdx'

<JsonnetWarning format="Jsonnet code snippets" use="data mapping" />
```

## Configuration using the Ory CLI

Follow these steps to add a generic provider as a social sign-in provider to your project using the Ory CLI:

1. Create a client at your generic provider to get a Client ID and Client Secret.
2. Create a [Jsonnet code snippet](#data-mapping) to map the desired claims to the Ory Identity schema.
3. Encode the Jsonnet snippet with [Base64](https://www.base64encode.org/) or host it under an URL accessible to The Ory Network.
4. Download the Ory Identities config from your project and save it to a file:

   ```shell
   ## List all available projects
   ory list projects

   ## Get config
   ory get identity-config <project-id> --format yaml > identity-config.yaml
   ```

5. Add the social sign-in provider configuration to the downloaded config. Add the Jsonnet snippet with mappings as a Base64
   string or provide an URL to the file.

   ```yaml
   selfservice:
     methods:
       oidc:
         config:
           providers:
             - id: generic # this is `<provider-id>` in the Authorization callback URL. DO NOT CHANGE IT ONCE SET!
               provider: generic
               client_id: .... # Replace this with the Client ID
               client_secret: .... # Replace this with the Client secret
               issuer_url: https://accounts.google.com # Replace this with the providers issuer URL
               mapper_url: "base64://<YOUR_BASE64_ENCODED_JSONNET_HERE>"
               # Alternatively, use an URL:
               # mapper_url: https://storage.googleapis.com/abc-cde-prd/9cac9717f007808bf17f22ce7f4295c739604b183f05ac4afb4
               scope:
                 - email
               # supported scopes can be found in your providers dev docs
         enabled: true
   ```

6. Update the Ory Identities (Ory Kratos) configuration using the file you worked with:

   ```shell
   ory update identity-config <project-id> --file updated_config.yaml
   ```

## Configuration for self-hosted instances

Follow these steps to add a generic provider as a social sign-in provider when self-hosting Ory Kratos:

1. Create a client at your generic provider to get a Client ID and Client Secret.
2. Set the redirect URI to URL that follows this pattern:

   ```shell
   http(s)://<domain-of-ory-kratos>:<public-port>/self-service/methods/oidc/callback/<social-signin-provider-id>
   ```

3. Create a [Jsonnet code snippet](#data-mapping) to map the desired claims to the Ory Identity schema.
4. Encode the Jsonnet snippet with [Base64](https://www.base64encode.org/) or store it in a location available to your Ory Kratos
   instance.
5. Add the [social sign-in provider configuration](#configuration-with-ory-cli) to the Ory Kratos configuration. Add the Jsonnet
   snippet with mappings as a Base64 string or provide a path or an URL of the file.

```mdx-code-block
import ConfigAsEnv from '../_common/config_as_env.mdx'

<ConfigAsEnv />
```

## Prevent having to log in after sign-up

```mdx-code-block
import OidcSessionHook from '../_common/oidc_session_hook.mdx'

<OidcSessionHook />
```
