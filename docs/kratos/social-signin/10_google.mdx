:::note

To add Google as a social sign-in provider, you need a Google Developer account. Go to
[Google Cloud Console](https://console.developers.google.com/) to create one.

:::

## Configuration in Ory Cloud Console

Follow these steps to add Google as a social sign-in provider for your Ory Cloud project using the Ory Cloud Console.

1. Sign in to Ory Cloud Console and select [**Social Sign-in**](https://console.ory.sh/projects/current/social-signin).
2. Click the switch next to the Google logo to start the configuration.
3. Copy the Redirect URI and save it for later use.
4. Go to [Google Cloud Console → APIs & Services](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/) to set up OAuth 2.
5. Using the project dropdown menu, select an existing project or create a new one.
6. Go to [Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) and create a new
   [OAuth client ID](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/oauthclient).

   :::info

   You must have a consent screen configured to proceed.

   :::

7. Configure the Google OAuth client. In the **Authorized redirect URIs** section, add the redirect URI copied from the Ory Cloud
   Console.
8. Save the configuration and copy the Client ID and Client secret.
9. Paste the Client ID and Client secret of the created OAuth client into the corresponding fields in the Ory Cloud Console.
10. Click **Save Configuration** to enable Google as a social sign-in provider.

:::note

These steps cover the basic configuration of a social sign-in provider integration. At this point, the user experience is
incomplete. To complete the configuration and ensure a smooth and secure user experience, configure the [scopes](#scopes) and
[data mapping](#data-mapping) as described in the next section.

:::

### Additional configuration

When adding a social sign-in provider, you can customize the integration by defining the OAuth scopes Ory requests from the
provider and by setting up custom data mappings.

#### Scopes

The Scopes section allows you to define the OAuth scopes Ory requests from the sign-in provider. Defining scopes allows you to
interact with the provider's APIs on behalf of the user, or to access additional user data, which is exposed as claims for data
mapping.

For Google, add the `email`, `email_verified`, `given_name`, and `family_name` scopes for a basic setup.

To learn more about the scopes available for Google, read the
[related documentation](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/scopes).

#### Data Mapping

The Data Mapping section allows you to map the data returned by the sign-in provider to traits as defined in the identity schema.

To define the mapping, create a Jsonnet code snippet. Read [this document](./data-mapping) to learn more about Jsonnet data
mapping.

```jsonnet
local claims = {
  email_verified: true,
} + std.extVar('claims');

{
  identity: {
    traits: {
      [if 'email' in claims && claims.email_verified then 'email' else null]: claims.email,
      first_name: claims.given_name,
      last_name: claims.family_name,
      [if 'hd' in claims && claims.email_verified then 'hd' else null]: claims.hd,
    },
  },
}
```

The sample Jsonnet snippet creates the following mapping:

| Google claim | Ory Identity schema mapping |
| :----------- | :-------------------------- |
| email        | email                       |
| given_name   | first_name                  |
| family_name  | last_name                   |

```mdx-code-block
import JsonnetWarning from '../../_common/jsonnetwarning.mdx'

<JsonnetWarning format="Jsonnet code snippets" use="data mapping" />
```

:::tip

For Google, you can use the `hd` claim which is the hosted Google Workplace domain of the user. This claim is used only when the
user has a Google Workspace account.

To learn more about the ID payload returned by Google, read the
[related documentation](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/openid-connect#an-id-tokens-payload).

## Configuration using the Ory CLI

Follow these steps to add Google as a social sign-in provider to your Ory Cloud project using the Ory CLI:

1. [Create a Google OAuth client](#configuration-in-ory-cloud-console).
2. Create a [Jsonnet code snippet](#data-mapping) to map the desired claims to the Ory Identity schema.
3. Encode the Jsonnet snippet with [Base64](https://www.base64encode.org/) or host it under an URL accessible to Ory Cloud.
4. Download the Identity Service config from your Ory Cloud project and save it to a file:

   ```shell
   ## List all available projects
   ory list projects

   ## Get config
   ory get identity-config <project-id> --format yaml > identity-config.yaml
   ```

5. Add the social sign-in provider configuration to the downloaded config. Add the Jsonnet snippet with mappings as a Base64
   string or provide an URL to the file.

   ```yaml
   selfservice:
     methods:
       oidc:
         config:
           providers:
             - id: google # this is `<provider-id>` in the Authorization callback URL. DO NOT CHANGE IT ONCE SET!
               provider: google
               client_id: .... # Replace this with the OAuth2 Client ID
               client_secret: .... # Replace this with the OAuth2 Client secret
               mapper_url: "base64://<YOUR_BASE64_ENCODED_JSONNET_HERE>"
               # Alternatively, use an URL:
               # mapper_url: https://storage.googleapis.com/abc-cde-prd/9cac9717f007808bf17f22ce7f4295c739604b183f05ac4afb4
               scope:
                 - email
                 - profile
               # other supported scopes can be found in Google OAuth 2.0 dev docs
               requested_claims:
                 id_token:
                   email:
                     essential: true
                   email_verified:
                     essential: true
                   given_name:
                     essential: true
                   family_name: null
                   hd: null # If you want the Google Workspace domain
         enabled: true
   ```

6. Update the Ory Identity Service (Ory Kratos) configuration using the file you worked with:

   ```shell
   ory update identity-config <project-id> --file updated_config.yaml
   ```

## Configuration for self-hosted instances

Follow these steps to add Google as a social sign-in provider when self-hosting Ory Kratos:

1. [Create a Google OAuth client](#configuration-in-ory-cloud-console).
2. Set the redirect URI to URL that follows this pattern:

   ```shell
   http(s)://<domain-of-ory-kratos>:<public-port>/self-service/methods/oidc/callback/<social-signin-provider-id>
   ```

3. Create a [Jsonnet code snippet](#data-mapping) to map the desired claims to the Ory Identity schema.
4. Encode the Jsonnet snippet with [Base64](https://www.base64encode.org/) or store it in a location available to your Ory Kratos
   instance.
5. Add the [social sign-in provider configuration](#configuration-with-ory-cli) to the Ory Kratos configuration. Add the Jsonnet
   snippet with mappings as a Base64 string or provide a path or an URL of the file.

```mdx-code-block
import ConfigAsEnv from '../_common/config_as_env.mdx'

<ConfigAsEnv />
```

## Prevent having to log in after sign-up

```mdx-code-block
import OidcSessionHook from '../_common/oidc_session_hook.mdx'

<OidcSessionHook />
```
