# Patreon

Follow these steps to add Patreon as a social sign-in provider to your project using the Ory CLI:

1. Create a [Patreon OAuth2 client](https://www.patreon.com/portal/registration/register-clients).
2. In the client configuration, set the redirect URI to:

   ```shell
   https://{project.slug}.projects.oryapis.com/self-service/methods/oidc/callback/patreon
   ```

3. Create a Jsonnet code snippet to map the desired claims to the Ory Identity schema.

   **Available Claims**  
   All claims require the `identity` scope

   - Subject: Id of the patreon user
   - Email: The patron's email (Additionally requires the `identity[email]` scope)
   - Name: The patron's full name
   - GivenName: The patron's first name
   - FamilyName: The patron's last name (Same as `LastName`)
   - LastName: The patron's last name (Same as `FamilyName`)
   - Picture: A URL to a patron's profile image if present

   [More information available about patreon's oauth here](https://docs.patreon.com/#apiv2-oauth)

   ```jsonnet
   local claims = std.extVar('claims');
   {
     identity: {
       traits: {
         [if "email" in claims then "email" else null]: claims.email,
       },
     },
   }
   ```

4. Encode the Jsonnet snippet with [Base64](https://www.base64encode.org/) or host it under an URL accessible to The Ory Network.

   ```shell
   cat your-data-mapping.jsonnet | base64
   ```

5. Download the Ory Identities config from your project and save it to a file:

   ```shell
   ## List all available projects
   ory list projects

   ## Get config
   ory get identity-config {project-id} --format yaml > identity-config.yaml
   ```

6. Add the social sign-in provider configuration to the downloaded config. Add the Jsonnet snippet with mappings as a Base64
   string or provide an URL to the file.

   ```yaml
   selfservice:
     methods:
       oidc:
         enabled: true
         config:
           providers:
             - id: patreon # this is `<provider-id>` in the Authorization callback URL. DO NOT CHANGE IT ONCE SET!
               provider: patreon
               client_id: .... # Replace this with the OAuth2 Client ID provided by Patreon
               client_secret: .... # Replace this with the OAuth2 Client Secret provided by Patreon
               mapper_url: "base64://{YOUR_BASE64_ENCODED_JSONNET_HERE}"
               # Alternatively, use an URL:
               # mapper_url: https://storage.googleapis.com/abc-cde-prd/9cac9717f007808bf17f22ce7f4295c739604b183f05ac4afb4

               # Patreon's scopes are [documented here](https://docs.patreon.com/#scopes)
               scope:
                 - identity
                 - identity[email]
                 - identity.memberships
                 - campaigns
                 - w:campaigns.webhook
                 - campaigns.members
                 - campaigns.members[email]
                 - campaigns.members.address
                 - campaigns.posts
   ```

7. Update the Ory Identities configuration using the file you worked with:

   ```shell
   ory update identity-config {project-id} --file updated_config.yaml
   ```
