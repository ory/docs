Follow these steps to add GitHub as a social sign-in provider for your for your project using the Ory Console.

1. Go to <ConsoleLink route="project.socialSignIn" />.
2. Click the switch next to the GitHub logo to start the configuration.
3. Copy the Redirect URI and save it for later use.
4. Create an OAuth2 app in GitHub. Open a new browser tab, go to
   [Developer settings â†’ OAuth Apps](https://github.com/settings/developers) and click **New OAuth App**.

   :::info

   Currently, the Ory Console allows you to integrate with GitHub through a GitHub OAuth App. If you want to create an integration
   through a
   [GitHub App](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/getting-started-with-apps/differences-between-github-apps-and-oauth-apps),
   use the Ory CLI.

   :::

5. Paste the Redirect URI copied from Ory into the **Authorization Callback URL** field in GitHub and fill in other required app
   details.
6. Click the **Register application** button.
7. Copy the Client ID of the registered application and paste it into the corresponding field in Ory Console.
8. In GitHub, click **Generate a new client secret**, copy the generated string, and paste it into the corresponding field in Ory
   Console.
9. Click **Save Configuration** to enable the social sign-in provider.

:::note

These steps cover the basic configuration of a social sign-in provider integration. At this point, the user experience is
incomplete. To complete the configuration and ensure a smooth and secure user experience, configure the [scopes](#scopes) and
[data mapping](#data-mapping) as described in the next section.

:::

## Additional configuration

When adding a social sign-in provider, you can customize the integration by defining the OAuth scopes Ory requests from the
provider and by setting up custom data mappings.

### Scopes

The Scopes section allows you to define the OAuth scopes Ory requests from the sign-in provider. Defining scopes allows you to
interact with the provider's APIs on behalf of the user, or to access additional user data, which is exposed as claims for data
mapping.

For GitHub, add the `user:email` scope for a basic setup.

To learn more about the scopes available for GitHub, read the
[related documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-oauth-apps/scopes-for-oauth-apps).

### Data mapping

The **Data mapping** section allows you to map the data returned by the sign-in provider to traits as defined in the identity
schema.

To define the mapping, create a Jsonnet code snippet. Read [this document](./data-mapping) to learn more about Jsonnet data
mapping.

:::info

GitHub doesn't implement OpenID Connect. Because of this limitation, Ory Identities makes a request to
[GitHub's User API](https://developer.github.com/v3/users/#get-the-authenticated-user) and adds the user data to
`std.extVar('claims')`. Learn what data is available by reading the
[GitHub Scopes documentation](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/understanding-scopes-for-oauth-apps/). Not all
GitHub scopes are supported. Check the list of supported scopes in
[the source code](https://github.com/ory/kratos/blob/master/selfservice/strategy/oidc/provider_github.go#L77-L86).

:::

In this sample Jsonnet snippet, `email_primary` is mapped to the identity schema's `traits.email`:

```jsonnet
local claims = {
  email_verified: false,
} + std.extVar('claims');
{
  identity: {
    traits: {
      // Allowing unverified email addresses enables account
      // enumeration attacks, especially if the value is used for
      // e.g. verification or as a password login identifier.
      //
      // Therefore we only return the email if it (a) exists and (b) is marked verified
      // by GitHub.
      [if 'email' in claims && claims.email_verified then 'email' else null]: claims.email,
    },
  },
}
```

```mdx-code-block
import JsonnetWarning from '../../_common/jsonnetwarning.mdx'

<JsonnetWarning format="Jsonnet code snippets" use="data mapping" />

Follow these steps to add GitHub as a social sign-in provider to your project using the Ory CLI:

1. Create a GitHub OAuth app or a GitHub App.
2. Create a Jsonnet code snippet to map the desired claims to the Ory Identity schema.

    :::info

    GitHub doesn't implement OpenID Connect. Because of this limitation, Ory Identities makes a request to
    [GitHub's User API](https://developer.github.com/v3/users/#get-the-authenticated-user) and adds the user data to
    `std.extVar('claims')`. Learn what data is available by reading the
    [GitHub Scopes documentation](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/understanding-scopes-for-oauth-apps/). Not all
    GitHub scopes are supported. Check the list of supported scopes in
    [the source code](https://github.com/ory/kratos/blob/v0.2.1-alpha.1/selfservice/strategy/oidc/provider_github.go#L72-L98).

    :::

    In this sample Jsonnet snippet, `email_primary` is mapped to the identity schema's `traits.email`:

    ```jsonnet
    local claims = {
      email_verified: false,
    } + std.extVar('claims');
    {
      identity: {
        traits: {
          // Allowing unverified email addresses enables account
          // enumeration attacks, especially if the value is used for
          // e.g. verification or as a password login identifier.
          //
          // Therefore we only return the email if it (a) exists and (b) is marked verified
          // by GitHub.
          [if 'email' in claims && claims.email_verified then 'email' else null]: claims.email,
        },
      },
    }
    ```

3. Encode the Jsonnet snippet with [Base64](https://www.base64encode.org/) or host it under an URL accessible to Ory Network.

  ```shell
  cat your-data-mapping.jsonnet | base64
  ```

4. Download the Ory Identities config from your project and save it to a file:

   ```shell
   ## List all available projects
   ory list projects

   ## Get config
   ory get identity-config {project-id} --format yaml > identity-config.yaml
   ```

5. Add the social sign-in provider configuration to the downloaded config. Add the Jsonnet snippet with mappings as a Base64
   string or provide an URL to the file.

   ```yaml
   selfservice:
     methods:
       oidc:
         config:
           providers:
             - id: github # this is `<provider-id>` in the Authorization callback URL. DO NOT CHANGE IT ONCE SET!
               provider: github # This defines the app type used for integration. Use 'github' for GitHub OAuth app. Use 'github-app' for GitHub App.
               client_id: .... # Replace this with the OAuth2 Client ID provided by GitHub
               client_secret: .... # Replace this with the OAuth2 Client Secret provided by GitHub
               mapper_url: "base64://{YOUR_BASE64_ENCODED_JSONNET_HERE}"
               # Alternatively, use an URL:
               # mapper_url: https://storage.googleapis.com/abc-cde-prd/9cac9717f007808bf17f22ce7f4295c739604b183f05ac4afb4
               scope:
                 - user:email
         enabled: true
   ```

6. Update the Ory Identities configuration using the file you worked with:

   ```shell
   ory update identity-config {project-id} --file identity-config.yaml
   ```
