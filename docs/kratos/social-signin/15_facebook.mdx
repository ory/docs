# Facebook

:::note

To add Facebook as a social sign-in provider, you need a Facebook Developer account. Go to
[Facebook Developers](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/register) to create one.

````mdx-code-block
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="console" label="Ory Console" default>

Follow these steps to add Facebook as a social sign-in provider for your to your project using the Ory Console.

1. Go to <ConsoleLink route="project.socialSignIn" />.
2. Click the switch next to the Facebook logo to start the configuration.
3. Copy the Redirect URI and save it for later use.
4. In your Facebook Developers account, go to **My Apps → Create App**.
5. Select **Consumer** and click **Next**.
6. Enter you app's name and preferred contact email. Click **Create App**.
7. Next select the Dashboard and click on the item "Facebook Login". On the next screen add the email permission.
8. Next select **App-Settings → Basic** from the sidebar on the bottom left.
9. Copy the Client ID and Client secret from Facebook and paste them into the corresponding fields in the Ory Console.
10. On Facebook Developers, click **Save Changes**.
11. From the left navigation bar, select **Facebook Login → Settings**.
12. Paste the redirect URI copied from Ory into the **Valid OAuth redirect URIs** and click **Save Changes**.
13. In the Ory Console, click **Save Configuration** to enable Facebook as a social sign-in provider.

:::note

These steps cover the basic configuration of a social sign-in provider integration. At this point, the user experience is
incomplete. To complete the configuration and ensure a smooth and secure user experience, configure the [scopes](#scopes) and
[data mapping](#data-mapping) as described in the next section.

:::

## Additional configuration

When adding a social sign-in provider, you can customize the integration by defining the OAuth scopes Ory requests from the
provider and by setting up custom data mappings.

### Scopes

The Scopes section allows you to define the OAuth scopes Ory requests from the sign-in provider. Defining scopes allows you to
interact with the provider's APIs on behalf of the user, or to access additional user data, which is exposed as claims for data
mapping.

For Facebook, add the `email` scope for a basic setup.

To learn more about the scopes available for Facebook, read the
[related documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/permissions/reference/).

### Data mapping

The **Data mapping** section allows you to map the data returned by the sign-in provider to traits as defined in the identity
schema.

To define the mapping, create a Jsonnet code snippet. Read [this document](./data-mapping) to learn more about Jsonnet data
mapping.

In this sample Jsonnet snippet, the user's `email`, is mapped to `email` in the identity schema.

```jsonnet
local claims = std.extVar('claims');
{
  identity: {
    traits: {
      // The email might be empty if the user hasn't granted permissions for the email scope.
      [if 'email' in claims then 'email' else null]: claims.email,
    },
  },
}
```

:::info

[Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/) only returns `access_token` and doesn't return `id_token`. Ory
sends requests to [Facebook's graph.facebook.com/me API](https://graph.facebook.com/me) and adds the user info to
`std.extVar('claims')`.

:::

```mdx-code-block
import JsonnetWarning from '../../_common/jsonnetwarning.mdx'

<JsonnetWarning format="Jsonnet code snippets" use="data mapping" />
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="cli" label="Ory CLI">

Follow these steps to add Facebook as a social sign-in provider to your project using the Ory CLI:

1. Create a Facebook app.
2. Create a Jsonnet code snippet to map the desired claims to the Ory Identity schema.

    ```jsonnet
    local claims = std.extVar('claims');
    {
      identity: {
        traits: {
          // The email might be empty if the user hasn't granted permissions for the email scope.
          [if 'email' in claims then 'email' else null]: claims.email,
        },
      },
    }
    ```

    :::info

    [Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/) only returns `access_token` and doesn't return `id_token`. Ory
    sends requests to [Facebook's graph.facebook.com/me API](https://graph.facebook.com/me) and adds the user info to
    `std.extVar('claims')`.

    :::

3. Encode the Jsonnet snippet with [Base64](https://www.base64encode.org/) or host it under an URL accessible to Ory Network.

  ```shell
  cat your-data-mapping.jsonnet | base64
  ```

4. Download the Ory Identities config from your project and save it to a file:

   ```shell
   ## List all available projects
   ory list projects

   ## Get config
   ory get identity-config {project-id} --format yaml > identity-config.yaml
   ```

5. Add the social sign-in provider configuration to the downloaded config. Add the Jsonnet snippet with mappings as a Base64
   string or provide an URL to the file.

   ```yaml
   selfservice:
   methods:
     oidc:
       config:
         providers:
           - id: facebook # this is `<provider-id>` in the Authorization callback URL. DO NOT CHANGE IT ONCE SET!
             provider: facebook
             client_id: .... # Replace this with the OAuth2 Client ID provided by Facebook app
             client_secret: .... # Replace this with the OAuth2 Client Secret provided by Facebook app
             mapper_url: "base64://{YOUR_BASE64_ENCODED_JSONNET_HERE}"
             # Alternatively, use an URL:
             # mapper_url: https://storage.googleapis.com/abc-cde-prd/9cac9717f007808bf17f22ce7f4295c739604b183f05ac4afb4
             scope:
               - email
             # required for email and email_verified claims in the near future
             # other supported scopes: user_gender, user_birthday
       enabled: true
   ```

6. Update the Ory Identities configuration using the file you worked with:

   ```shell
   ory update identity-config {project-id} --file identity-config.yaml
   ```
