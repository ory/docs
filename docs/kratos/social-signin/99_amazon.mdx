To add Amazon as a social sign-in provider, you need a Amazon Developer account. Go to
[Amazon Developers](https://developer.amazon.com/) to create one.

Follow these steps to add Amazon as a social sign-in provider for your project, using the Ory Console.

1. Go to <ConsoleLink route="project.socialSignIn" />.
1. Enable the **Enable OpenID Connect** toggle, then click **Add new OpenID Connect provider**.
1. Click the Amazon logo to open the **Configure Amazon** screen. You may need to click **Show more providers** to see the full list of providers.
1. Copy the Redirect URI and save it for later use.
1. Follow the [official steps](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/login-with-amazon/register-web.html) to create a security profile.
1. Once you've created the security profile, click **Show Client Secret** and copy the Client ID and Client secret. Then paste them into the corresponding fields in the Ory Console's **Configure Amazon** screen.
1. In the Ory Console, click **Save Configuration** to enable Amazon as a social sign-in provider.
1. On Amazon Developers, click **Save Changes**.
1. Open the Amazon **Security Profile Management** screen, select the **Web Settings** tab, click **Edit**, and paste the redirect URI into the **Allowed Return URLs** field. Click **Save**.

:::note

These steps cover the basic configuration of a social sign-in provider integration. At this point, the user experience is
incomplete. To complete the configuration and ensure a smooth and secure user experience, configure the [scopes](#scopes) and
[data mapping](#data-mapping) as described in the next section.

:::

## Additional configuration

When adding a social sign-in provider, you can customize the integration by defining the OAuth scopes Ory requests from the
provider and by setting up custom data mappings.

### Scopes

In the **Scopes** field, you can define the OAuth (access) scopes that Ory requests from the sign-in provider. Defining access scopes enables you to
interact with the provider's APIs on behalf of the user, or to access additional user data, which is exposed as claims for data
mapping.

For a basic setup, follow these steps to add the profile access scope:

- In Ory Console's **Configure Amazon** screen, click **Show advanced settings**.
- In the **Scopes** field, enter `profile` and click **Add**.

To learn more about the scopes available for Amazon, read the
[related documentation](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/login-with-amazon/customer-profile.html).

### Data mapping

In the **Data mapping** field, you can map the data returned by the sign-in provider to traits as defined in the identity
schema.

To define the mapping, create a Jsonnet code snippet. Read [this document](./data-mapping) to learn more about Jsonnet data
mapping.

In this sample Jsonnet snippet, the user's `email`, is mapped to `email` in the identity schema.

```jsonnet
local claims = std.extVar('claims');
{
  identity: {
    traits: {
      // The email might be empty if the user hasn't granted permissions for the email scope.
      [if 'email' in claims then 'email' else null]: claims.email,
    },
  },
}
```

<TabItem value="cli" label="Ory CLI">
Follow these steps to add Amazon as a social sign-in provider to your project using the Ory CLI:

1. Encode the Jsonnet snippet with [Base64](https://www.base64encode.org/) or host it under an URL accessible to Ory Network.
   ```shell
   cat your-data-mapping.jsonnet | base64
   ```
1. Download the Ory Identities config from your project and save it to a file:
   ```shell
   ## List all available workspaces
   ory list workspaces

   ## List all available projects
   ory list projects --workspace <workspace-id>

   ## Get config
   ory get identity-config --project <project-id> --workspace <workspace-id> --format yaml > identity-config.yaml
   ```
1. Add the social sign-in provider configuration to the downloaded config. Add the Jsonnet snippet with mappings as a Base64
   string or provide an URL to the file.
   ```yaml
   selfservice:
   methods:
     oidc:
       config:
         providers:
           - id: amazon # this is `<provider-id>` in the Authorization callback URL. DO NOT CHANGE IT ONCE SET!
             provider: amazon
             client_id: .... # Replace this with the OAuth2 Client ID provided by Amazon app
             client_secret: .... # Replace this with the OAuth2 Client Secret provided by Amazon app
             mapper_url: "base64://{YOUR_BASE64_ENCODED_JSONNET_HERE}"
             # Alternatively, use an URL like this example
             # mapper_url: https://storage.googleapis.com/example-example-prd/example-file
             scope:
               - profile
             pkce: "force"
       enabled: true
   ```
1. Update the Ory Identities configuration using the file you worked with:
   ```shell
   ory update identity-config --project <project-id> --workspace <workspace-id> --file identity-config.yaml
   ```
