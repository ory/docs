# Lark

Follow these steps to add Lark as a social sign-in provider to your project using the Ory CLI:

1. Create an application in the [Feishu Open Platform Developer Console](https://open.feishu.cn/app) and obtain the ID and secret
   of the application.
2. In the created app, set the redirect URI to:

   ```shell
   https://{project.slug}.projects.oryapis.com/self-service/methods/oidc/callback/lark
   ```

3. Create a Jsonnet code snippet to map the desired claims to the Ory Identity schema. For specific information
   [Lark's User API](https://open.feishu.cn/document/common-capabilities/sso/api/get-user-info) can be viewed.

   ```jsonnet
   local claims = std.extVar('claims');
   {
     identity: {
       traits: {
         // Allowing unverified email addresses enables account
         // enumeration attacks, especially if the value is used for
         // e.g. verification or as a password login identifier.
         //
         // Therefore we only return the email if it (a) exists by lark.
         [if "email" in claims then "email" else null]: claims.email,
       },
     },
   }
   ```

```mdx-code-block
import JsonnetWarning from '../../_common/jsonnetwarning.mdx'

<JsonnetWarning format="Jsonnet code snippets" use="data mapping" />
```

4. Encode the Jsonnet snippet with [Base64](https://www.base64encode.org/) or host it under an URL accessible to The Ory Network.

   ```shell
   cat your-data-mapping.jsonnet | base64
   ```

5. Download the Ory Identities config from your project and save it to a file:

   ```shell
   ## List all available projects
   ory list projects

   ## Get config
   ory get identity-config {project-id} --format yaml > identity-config.yaml
   ```

6. Add the social sign-in provider configuration to the downloaded config. Add the Jsonnet snippet with mappings as a Base64
   string or provide an URL to the file.

   ```yaml
   selfservice:
     methods:
       oidc:
         enabled: true
         config:
           providers:
             - id: lark # this is `<provider-id>` in the Authorization callback URL. DO NOT CHANGE IT ONCE SET!
               provider: lark
               client_id: .... # Replace this with the OAuth2 Client ID provided by lark
               client_secret: .... # Replace this with the OAuth2 Client Secret provided by lark
               mapper_url: "base64://{YOUR_BASE64_ENCODED_JSONNET_HERE}"
               # Alternatively, use an URL:
               # mapper_url: https://storage.googleapis.com/abc-cde-prd/9cac9717f007808bf17f22ce7f4295c739604b183f05ac4afb4

               # Lark uses a fixed scope for applications that should be configured on its admin page. therefore you can use an empty scope list here.
               scope: []
   ```

7. Update the Ory Identities configuration using the file you worked with:

   ```shell
   ory update identity-config {project-id} --file identity-config.yaml
   ```
