sidebar_label: Get social sign-in provider tokens
---

You can get the OIDC / OAuth 2.0 access, refresh, and ID tokens issued for the identity by social sign-in providers.

These tokens are issued only when the Identity:

- Signs up with a social sign-in provider.
- Links a new social sign-in provider to their account.

Run this command to get the Identity details that include the social sign-in provider tokens:

````mdx-code-block
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs'
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem'

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="The Ory Network">

Use the Ory CLI:

```shell
ory get identity <IDENTITY_ID> --project <ORY_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID> -i oidc --format yaml
```

Alternatively, call the API:

```shell
curl --request GET -sL \
     --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
     --header "Authorization: Bearer <ORY_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN>" \
    'https://<project-slug>.projects.oryapis.com/admin/identities/<identity_id>?include_credential=oidc'
```

:::info

When calling the API directly, you must include a valid Personal Access Token (PAT) created for the project with the requested
Identity in the call.

To get a PAT, sign in at [console.ory.sh](https://console.ory.sh/), select **Connect** from the left
navigation panel, and create a new token in the **Personal Access Tokens** section.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Self-hosted Instances">

```
curl --request GET -sL \
     --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
    http://127.0.0.1:4434/admin/identities/<identity_id>\?include_credential\=oidc
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
````

When the call is successful, the system returns the Identity details with the available social sign-in provider tokens:

```sh

  "id": "IDENTITY_ID",
  "credentials": {
    "oidc": {
      "type": "oidc",

## Encryption

By default, tokens are stored as plain text recorded with the default Noop cipher.

To increase the security, you can choose to encode the tokens with AES or XChaCha20 Poly1305 ciphers. Read
[this document](../../kratos/guides/select-cipher-algorithm) to learn how to choose the cipher.
