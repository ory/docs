Follow these steps to add NetID as a social sign-in provider to your project using the Ory Console:

1. Go to <ConsoleLink route="project.socialSignIn" />.
2. Click the switch next to the NetID logo to start the configuration.
3. Copy the Redirect URI and save it for later use.
4. Create a [NetID Service](https://developerzone.netid.dev/latest/devportal/tutorial/services/) and
   [NetID Client](https://developerzone.netid.dev/latest/devportal/tutorial/clients/).
5. Enter the Redirect URI you copied from Ory to the **Callback URL** field of the NetID Client.
6. After creating the NetID Client, the client is initially in sandbox mode, which is a pre-production state
   prior to the release of your NetID Service.
   If you want to test your NetID Client while it is in sandbox mode, you need to create one or more test users,
   by going to the NetID Service page and clicking **Add test user**.
7. Copy the following data from the NetID Client settings to the corresponding fields in the form in the Ory Console:
    - **Client ID**
    - **Client secret** (sandbox or live, depending on the status of the NetID Service)
8. In the **Scopes** field of the form in the Ory Console, add the following scopes:
    - `openid`
    - `email`
9. In the **Data Mapping** field of the form in the Ory Console, add the following Jsonnet code snippet,
   which maps the desired claims to the Ory Identity schema:

   ```jsonnet
   local claims = {
     email_verified: false
   } + std.extVar('claims');

   {
     identity: {
       traits: {
         // Allowing unverified email addresses enables account
         // enumeration attacks,  if the value is used for
         // verification or as a password login identifier.
         //
         // Therefore we only return the email if it (a) exists and (b) is marked verified
         // by NetID.
         [if "email" in claims && claims.email_verified then "email" else null]: claims.email,
       },
     },
   }
   ```

```mdx-code-block
   <JsonnetWarning format="Jsonnet code snippets" use="data mapping" />
```

10. Click **Save Configuration**.

<TabItem value="cli" label="Ory CLI">

Follow these steps to add NetID as a social sign-in provider to your project using the Ory CLI:

1. Create a [NetID Service](https://developerzone.netid.dev/latest/devportal/tutorial/services/) and
   [NetID Client](https://developerzone.netid.dev/latest/devportal/tutorial/clients/).
2. After creating the NetID Client, the client is initially in sandbox mode, which is a pre-production state
   prior to the release of your NetID Service.
   If you want to test your NetID Client while it is in sandbox mode, you need to create one or more test users,
   by going to the NetID Service page and clicking **Add test user**.
3. In the created app, set the redirect URI to:

   ```shell
   https://$PROJECT_SLUG.projects.oryapis.com/self-service/methods/oidc/callback/netid
   ```

4. Create a Jsonnet code snippet to map the desired claims to the Ory Identity schema.

   ```jsonnet
   local claims = {
     email_verified: false
   } + std.extVar('claims');

   {
     identity: {
       traits: {
         // Allowing unverified email addresses enables account
         // enumeration attacks,  if the value is used for
         // verification or as a password login identifier.
         //
         // Therefore we only return the email if it (a) exists and (b) is marked verified
         // by NetID.
         [if "email" in claims && claims.email_verified then "email" else null]: claims.email,
       },
     },
   }
   ```

   :::info

   [NetID](https://developerzone.netid.dev/sso/) returns only the `sub` and `sub_legacy` claims in the `id_token`. Ory makes a
   request to [NetID's /userinfo API](https://developerzone.netid.dev/sso/#userinfo-endpoint) and adds the user info to
   `std.extVar('claims')`.

   :::

```mdx-code-block
   <JsonnetWarning format="Jsonnet code snippets" use="data mapping" />
```

5. Encode the Jsonnet snippet with [Base64](https://www.base64encode.org/) or host it under an URL accessible to Ory Network.

   ```shell
   cat your-data-mapping.jsonnet | base64
   ```

6. Download the Ory Identities config from your project and save it to a file:

   ```shell
   ## List all available projects
   ory list projects

   ## Get config
   ory get identity-config {project-id} --format yaml > identity-config.yaml
   ```

7. Add the social sign-in provider configuration to the downloaded config. Add the Jsonnet snippet with mappings as a Base64
   string or provide an URL to the file.

   ```yaml
   selfservice:
     methods:
       oidc:
         config:
           providers:
             - id: netid # this is `<provider-id>` in the Authorization callback URL. DO NOT CHANGE IT ONCE SET!
               provider: netid
               client_id: .... # Replace this with the OAuth2 Client ID provided by NetID
               client_secret: .... # Replace this with the OAuth2 Client Secret provided by NetID
               mapper_url: "base64://{YOUR_BASE64_ENCODED_JSONNET_HERE}"
               # Alternatively, use an URL:
               # mapper_url: https://storage.googleapis.com/abc-cde-prd/9cac9717f007808bf17f22ce7f4295c739604b183f05ac4afb4t
               requested_claims: # for more information navigate to https://developerzone.netid.dev/sso/#claims-and-scopes
                 userinfo:
                   email:
                     essential: true
                   email_verified:
                     essential: true
                 id_token:
                   email:
                     essential: true
                   email_verified:
                     essential: true
               scope:
                 - email
                 - openid
         enabled: true
   ```

8. Update the Ory Identities configuration using the file you worked with:

   ```shell
   ory update identity-config {project-id} --file identity-config.yaml
   ```
