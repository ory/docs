## Overview

This page covers how to implement social sign-in for native applications via OIDC and OAuth 2.0. The user interaction looks like
this:

- The user is presented with a login or registration screen that includes a social sign-in button.
- The user clicks the social sign-in button. A browser window opens (using
  [ASWebAuthenticationSession](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/authenticationservices/aswebauthenticationsession) on iOS
  or [Custom Tabs](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/android/custom-tabs/) on Android).
- The user authenticates with the identity provider and grants the application access to profile information.
- The user is redirected back to the application and is logged in.

:::note

Apple and Google support a more tightly integrated login experience for native apps. See the documentation on
[Apple social sign-in](./apple#using-the-apple-sdk-on-native-apps) and
[Google social sign-in](./10_google.mdx#using-the-google-sdk-on-native-apps) for more information.

## The native app authentication flow

From a high level, the native app initializes a login or registration flow and receives the first part of the session token
exchange code from the Ory Network. After the user performed the social sign-in, the user is redirected back to the native
application via an [iOS Universal Link](https://developer.apple.com/ios/universal-links/) or
[Android App Link](https://developer.android.com/training/app-links). The native application then exchanges the session token
exchange code for a session token.

:::info

As part of this flow, Ory will redirect the browser to a callback. In this demo, we use the redirect URL
`http://localhost:19006/Callback`. Please ensure that this redirect URL is allowed. Go
to&nbsp;<ConsoleLink route="project.settings.endpoints" /> to allow it.

The flow looks like this:

```mdx-code-block
<Mermaid chart={`

`}/>
```

### Implementation

The following sections describe how to implement the native app authentication flow. The code examples are written in TypeScript
for React Native. The steps refer to the steps in the flow diagram above.

#### Steps 1-5: Create an API flow with return_session_token_exchange_code=true

The user opens the login screen (1) and the native application initializes a login or registration flow through the Ory Network
APIs (2) with the following parameters:

- The flow is of type `api`.
- The `return_to` parameter is set to the URL of the native application. This URL is used to redirect the user back to the app
  after the social sign-in.
- The `return_session_token_exchange_code` parameter is set to `true` to receive the session token exchange code in the response
  (3).

<CodeFromRemote
  lang="ts"
  src="https://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-react-native/blob/master/src/components/Routes/Login.tsx"
  startAt="  const initializeFlow = () =>"
  endAt="      .then(({ data: f }) => setFlow(f))"
/>

Upon rendering the form, the user selects the specific social sign-in provider (4). The native application submits the form to the
Ory Network (5).

#### Steps 6-12: Open the identity provider authentication URL in a browser

Ory Network returns a `422` status code if the user needs to perform a social sign-in from a flow of type `api` (6). The response
contains the URL of the identity provider in the `redirect_browser_to` field.

<CodeFromRemote
  lang="ts"
  src="https://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-react-native/blob/master/src/helpers/form.tsx"
  startAt="        case 422:"
  endAt="          )"
/>

[WebBrowser.openAuthSessionAsync](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/webbrowser/#webbrowseropenauthsessionasyncurl-redirecturl-options)
opens a browser tab for authentication for the specified `url` (7+8). Implementations in other languages and frameworks may vary.

<CodeFromRemote
  lang="ts"
  src="https://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-react-native/blob/master/src/helpers/form.tsx"
  startAt="  const result = await WebBrowser.openAuthSessionAsync("
  endAt="  )"
/>

The user authenticates with the identity provider and grants the application access to profile information (9). The identity
provider then issues a redirect to the Ory Network callback URL (10), which the browser follows (11).

#### Steps 12-14: Exchange the session token exchange code for a session token

Finally, Ory Network issues a session for the user and redirects the browser to the application's `return_to` URL (12). The native
application receives the second part of the session token exchange code in the `code` URL query parameter. In the example below,
the call to
[WebBrowser.maybeCompleteAuthSession](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/webbrowser/#webbrowsermaybecompleteauthsessionoptions)
is used to close the browser tab and return the control flow to the code that awaited the call to
`WebBrowser.openAuthSessionAsync`.

<CodeFromRemote
  lang="tsx"
  src="https://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-react-native/blob/master/src/components/Routes/Callback.tsx"
  startAt="const Callback = (props: Props) => {"
  endAt="  )"
/>

The native application then exchanges the session token exchange code for a session token (13) using the first part of the code
returned from the flow initialization, and the second part of the code returned from the `return_to` query parameter.

<CodeFromRemote
  lang="ts"
  src="https://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-react-native/blob/master/src/helpers/form.tsx"
  startAt="  const fetchToken = (params: FrontendApiExchangeSessionTokenRequest) =>"
  endAt='    newOrySdk("").exchangeSessionToken(params)'
/>

Finally, the native application stores the session token in the secure storage (14) and redirects the user to the home screen.

<CodeFromRemote
  lang="ts"
  src="https://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-react-native/blob/master/src/helpers/form.tsx"
  startAt="  const setToken = (res: Awaited<ReturnType<typeof fetchToken>>) =>"
  endAt="    })"
/>
