# Apple

:::note

To add Apple as a social sign-in provider, you need an Apple Developer account. Go to
[Enrolling and Verifying Your Identity with the Apple Developer App](https://developer.apple.com/support/app-account/) to create
one.

:::

## Webbrowser

```mdx-code-block
import JsonnetWarning from "../../_common/jsonnetwarning.mdx"
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="console" label="Ory Console" default>
```

Follow these steps to add Apple as a social sign-in provider to your project using the Ory Console:

1. Go to <ConsoleLink route="project.socialSignIn" />.
2. Click the switch next to the Apple logo to start the configuration.
3. Copy the Redirect URI and save it for later use.
4. Using an Apple Developer Account, create an app, a service, and a private key:
   1. To set up an application, navigate to the Apple Developer Dashboard and go to
      [Certs, Identifiers, and Profiles then Identifiers](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list).
   2. Create a new [**App IDs** identifier](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/add/bundleId). When prompted
      for a type select **App**.
   3. Enter a description and bundle ID of your liking.
   4. Scroll down and select **Sign in with Apple**.
   5. Click **Continue**, then **Register**.
   6. Go back to the [Identifiers overview](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list/serviceId).
   7. Next to the search icon open the dropdown and select "Services IDs".
   8. Create a new [Services ID](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/add/serviceId).
   9. Choose a description of your liking. The identifier **must match** the App ID value.
   10. Click **Continue**, then **Register**.
   11. Click on the newly created service identifier and click the "Sign in with Apple" checkbox.
   12. Click the **Configure** button and set the domains and subdomain to match your Ory Network domain (or custom hostname).
   13. Add the Redirect URI you received earlier and set it here as the return URL and click **Next**.
   14. Click **Continue**, then **Save**.
   15. Next, go to [**Keys**](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/authkeys/list) and
       [register a new key](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/authkeys/add).
   16. Set a key name and enable **Sign in with Apple**. Next to Sign in with Apple, click **Configure**.
   17. Use the App ID you created earlier as the primary AppID.
   18. Click **Continue**, then **Register**.
   19. **Download** the key and click **Done**.
5. Copy the correct identifiers to the Ory Console Apple configuration:
   - Client ID: Add the identifier of the Services ID (**not** the Bundle ID) you created in Apple. Not the ID of the App ID. Not
     the Team ID. Not the Name.
   - Client Secret Signing Key: Paste the contents of your key file downloaded from Apple. Paste the entire key, including the
     BEGIN/END PRIVATE KEY lines.
   - Apple Team ID: Add your Apple Team ID. In the Apple Developer Console top right menu, navigate to View Membership >
     Membership > Team ID.
   - Key ID: Paste the key ID of your Apple key. To find this, navigate to your
     [Apple Keys](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/authkeys/list) in the Apple Developer Console and open your key.
     Copy the **Key ID**.
   - Private Key: Paste the contents of the downloaded files into the field in the Ory Console.
6. In the **Scopes** field of the form in the Ory Console, add the following scope:
   - `email`
7. Copy the following details from your registered application in Apple to the corresponding fields in the Ory Console form:
   - **Apple Team Id**
   - **Apple Private Key Id**
   - **Apple Private Key**
8. In the **Data Mapping** field of the form in the Ory Console, add the following Jsonnet code snippet, which maps the desired
   claims to the Ory Identity schema:

   ```jsonnet
   local claims = {
     email_verified: false,
   } + std.extVar('claims');

   {
     identity: {
       traits: {
         // Allowing unverified email addresses enables account
         // enumeration attacks,  if the value is used for
         // verification or as a password login identifier.
         //
         // Therefore we only return the email if it (a) exists and (b) is marked verified
         // by Apple.
         [if 'email' in claims && claims.email_verified then 'email' else null]: claims.email,
       },
     },
   }
   ```

```mdx-code-block
   <JsonnetWarning format="Jsonnet code snippets" use="data mapping" />
```

9. Click **Save Configuration**.

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="cli" label="Ory CLI">
```

Follow these steps to add Apple as a social sign-in provider to your project using the Ory CLI:

1. Using an Apple Developer Account, create an app, a service, and a private key. Check the Ory Console guide for the concrete
   steps.
2. In the created app, set the redirect URI to:

   ```shell
   https://$PROJECT_SLUG.projects.oryapis.com/self-service/methods/oidc/callback/apple
   ```

3. Create a Jsonnet code snippet to map the desired claims to the Ory Identity schema.

   ```jsonnet
   local claims = {
     email_verified: false,
   } + std.extVar('claims');

   {
     identity: {
       traits: {
         // Allowing unverified email addresses enables account
         // enumeration attacks,  if the value is used for
         // verification or as a password login identifier.
         //
         // Therefore we only return the email if it (a) exists and (b) is marked verified
         // by Apple.
         [if 'email' in claims && claims.email_verified then 'email' else null]: claims.email,
       },
     },
   }
   ```

```mdx-code-block
   <JsonnetWarning format="Jsonnet code snippets" use="data mapping" />
```

4. Encode the Jsonnet snippet with [Base64](https://www.base64encode.org/) or host it under an URL accessible to Ory Network.

   ```shell
   cat your-data-mapping.jsonnet | base64
   ```

5. Download the Ory Identities config from your project and save it to a file:

   ```shell
   ## List all available projects
   ory list projects

   ## Get config
   ory get identity-config {project-id} --format yaml > identity-config.yaml
   ```

6. Add the social sign-in provider configuration to the downloaded config. Add the Jsonnet snippet with mappings as a Base64
   string or provide an URL to the file.

   ```yaml
   selfservice:
     methods:
       oidc:
         config:
           providers:
             - id: apple # this is `<provider-id>` in the Authorization callback URL. It should be "apple"
               provider: apple
               client_id: .... # Replace this with the Services ID provided by Apple
               apple_team_id: .... # Replace this with the Team ID provided by Apple
               apple_private_key_id: .... # Replace this with the private key identifier generated by Apple
               apple_private_key: |
                 -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
                 .... # Replace this with the content of the private key downloaded from Apple
                 -----END PRIVATE KEY-----
               issuer_url: https://appleid.apple.com
               mapper_url: "base64://{YOUR_BASE64_ENCODED_JSONNET_HERE}"
               # Alternatively, use an URL:
               # mapper_url: https://storage.googleapis.com/abc-cde-prd/9cac9717f007808bf17f22ce7f4295c739604b183f05ac4afb4
               scope:
                 - email
         enabled: true
   ```

7. Update the Ory Identities configuration using the file you worked with:

   ```shell
   ory update identity-config {project-id} --file identity-config.yaml
   ```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

## Using the Apple SDK on native apps

Apple provides a more integrated UX for native apps using the
[Apple SDK](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/sign_in_with_apple/implementing_user_authentication_with_sign_in_with_apple).
This flow uses the native Apple SDK and does not require a browser. This results in a signed `id_token` on the client side
(typically your app) which is exchanged at Ory for a session token.

The following steps are required to integrate the Apple SDK with Ory:

1. Configure an Apple social sign-in provider in Ory using the same `client_id` as in your native app.
2. Optional: iOS apps generate different token audiences per distribution (debug, release, etc.). You can add the ID of your
   current distribution to the `additional_id_token_audiences` field. Example: `sh.ory.network-example-ios.debug`.
3. Generate a random value that you can use as a `nonce`.
4. Obtain an `id_token` from Apple using the Apple SDK. Make sure to also submit the `nonce`.
5. Submit the `id_token` and `nonce` (as the `id_token_nonce`) as part of the `updateRegistrationFlow` or `updateLoginFlow`
   request to Ory.
6. Ory will validate the `id_token` and create an identity and optionally a session (if configured).

The `id_token` is verified using Apple's publicly available signing keys, available under https://appleid.apple.com/auth/keys.

The `id_token` issued by Apple only contains the user's email address. You can submit additional claims to Ory as part of the
`updateRegistrationFlow` request, as `traits`.

:::info

As Ory does not communicate directly with Apple during this flow, it does not have access to the Access & Refresh Tokens. This
means that Ory cannot return these in the admin APIs or SDK. If you need these tokens, you can exchange the `authorization_code`
returned by Apple on the device manually.

:::

```mdx-code-block
import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock'
import signInWithAppleSnippet from "!!raw-loader!@site/code-examples/sdk/typescript/src/selfservice/registration/apple-social-sign-in-native.ts"

<CodeBlock language="ts" title="apple-social-sign-in-react-native.tsx">{signInWithAppleSnippet}</CodeBlock>
```

## Troubleshooting

```mdx-code-block
import SocialSigninTroubleshooting from '../_common/social-sign-in-troubleshooting.mdx'

<SocialSigninTroubleshooting />
```

### Error: token audience didn't match allowed audiences

Make sure to either add your apps current identifier to the `additional_id_token_audiences` field or set it as the Client ID of
the provider in the Ory Console.
