# Apple

:::note

To add Apple as a social sign-in provider, you need an Apple Developer account. Go to
[Enrolling and Verifying Your Identity with the Apple Developer App](https://developer.apple.com/support/app-account/) to create
one.

````mdx-code-block
import JsonnetWarning from "../../_common/jsonnetwarning.mdx"
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="console" label="Ory Console" default>

Follow these steps to add Apple as a social sign-in provider to your project using the Ory Console:

1. Sign in to Ory Console and select [**Social Sign-in**](https://console.ory.sh/projects/current/social-signin).
2. Click the switch next to the Apple logo to start the configuration.
3. Copy the Redirect URI and save it for later use.
4. Using an Apple Developer Account, create an app, a service, and a private key.
5. Copy the **Services ID** from the Apple registered app to the **Client ID** field in the form in the Ory Console.
6. Add the saved Redirect URI from Ory to the **Return URLs** of the Apple registered application.
7. In the **Scopes** field of the form in the Ory Console, add the following scope:
    - `email`
8. Copy the following details from your registered application in Apple to the corresponding fields in the Ory Console form:
    - **Apple Team Id**
    - **Apple Private Key Id**
    - **Apple Private Key**
9. In the **Data Mapping** field of the form in the Ory Console, add the following Jsonnet code snippet,
   which maps the desired claims to the Ory Identity schema:

   ```jsonnet
   local claims = {
     email_verified: false,
   } + std.extVar('claims');

   {
     identity: {
       traits: {
         // Allowing unverified email addresses enables account
         // enumeration attacks,  if the value is used for
         // verification or as a password login identifier.
         //
         // Therefore we only return the email if it (a) exists and (b) is marked verified
         // by Apple.
         [if 'email' in claims && claims.email_verified then 'email' else null]: claims.email,
       },
     },
   }
   ```

   ```mdx-code-block
   <JsonnetWarning format="Jsonnet code snippets" use="data mapping" />
   ```

10. Click **Save Configuration**.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="cli" label="Ory CLI">

Follow these steps to add Apple as a social sign-in provider to your project using the Ory CLI:

1. Using an Apple Developer Account, create an app, a service, and a private key.
2. In the created app, set the redirect URI to:

   ```shell
   https://{project.slug}.projects.oryapis.com/self-service/methods/oidc/callback/apple
   ```

3. Create a Jsonnet code snippet to map the desired claims to the Ory Identity schema.

   ```jsonnet
   local claims = {
     email_verified: false,
   } + std.extVar('claims');

   {
     identity: {
       traits: {
         // Allowing unverified email addresses enables account
         // enumeration attacks,  if the value is used for
         // verification or as a password login identifier.
         //
         // Therefore we only return the email if it (a) exists and (b) is marked verified
         // by Apple.
         [if 'email' in claims && claims.email_verified then 'email' else null]: claims.email,
       },
     },
   }
   ```

   ```mdx-code-block
   <JsonnetWarning format="Jsonnet code snippets" use="data mapping" />
   ```
4. Encode the Jsonnet snippet with [Base64](https://www.base64encode.org/) or host it under an URL accessible to The Ory Network.

   ```shell
   cat your-data-mapping.jsonnet | base64
   ```

5. Download the Ory Identities config from your project and save it to a file:

   ```shell
   ## List all available projects
   ory list projects

   ## Get config
   ory get identity-config {project-id} --format yaml > identity-config.yaml
   ```

6. Add the social sign-in provider configuration to the downloaded config. Add the Jsonnet snippet with mappings as a Base64
   string or provide an URL to the file.

   ```yaml
   selfservice:
     methods:
       oidc:
         config:
           providers:
             - id: apple # this is `<provider-id>` in the Authorization callback URL. It should be "apple"
               provider: apple
               client_id: .... # Replace this with the Services ID provided by Apple
               apple_team_id: .... # Replace this with the Team ID provided by Apple
               apple_private_key_id: .... # Replace this with the private key identifier generated by Apple
               apple_private_key: |
                 -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
                 .... # Replace this with the content of the private key downloaded from Apple
                 -----END PRIVATE KEY-----
               issuer_url: https://appleid.apple.com
               mapper_url: "base64://{YOUR_BASE64_ENCODED_JSONNET_HERE}"
               # Alternatively, use an URL:
               # mapper_url: https://storage.googleapis.com/abc-cde-prd/9cac9717f007808bf17f22ce7f4295c739604b183f05ac4afb4
               scope:
                 - email
         enabled: true
   ```

7. Update the Ory Identities configuration using the file you worked with:

   ```shell
   ory update identity-config {project-id} --file updated_config.yaml
   ```
