# WorkOS

Follow these steps to add [WorkOS](https://workos.com/) as a social sign-in provider to your project using the Ory CLI:

:::info

The provider configuration in Kratos needs to be set up for each of your Enterprise SAML/SSO clients. WorkOS is simply a connector
that simplifies the SAML integration. The example below uses `demo-organization` but you would create one for each of your SAML
organizations.

:::

1. [Get your OAuth2 Credentials](https://dashboard.workos.com/api-keys) from WorkOS which are scoped to your environment

2. In the created app, add a redirect URI:

   ```shell
   https://{host}/self-service/methods/oidc/callback/demo-organization
   ```

3. Create a [Jsonnet code snippet](/docs/kratos/social-signin/generic#data-mapping) to map the desired claims to the Ory Identity
   schema.

4. Encode the Jsonnet snippet with [Base64](https://www.base64encode.org/) or host it under an URL accessible to Ory Network.

   ```shell
   cat your-data-mapping.jsonnet | base64
   ```

5. Download the Ory Identities config from your project and save it to a file:

   ```shell
   ## List all available projects
   ory list projects

   ## Get config
   ory get identity-config {project-id} --format yaml > identity-config.yaml
   ```

6. Add the social sign-in provider configuration to the downloaded config. Add the Jsonnet snippet with mappings as a Base64
   string or provide an URL to the file.

   ```yaml
   selfservice:
     methods:
       oidc:
         config:
           providers:
             - id: demo-organization
               provider: workos
               client_id: client_00000000000000000
               client_secret: sk_...
               workos_organization_id: org_000000000000000000
               mapper_url: "base64://..."
               scope: []
         enabled: true
   ```

7. Update the Ory Identities configuration using the file you worked with:

   ```shell
   ory update identity-config {project-id} --file identity-config.yaml
   ```
