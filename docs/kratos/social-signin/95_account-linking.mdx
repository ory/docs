# User account linking

Ory allows users to link their accounts to social sign-in providers after they sign up, as well as un-link social sign-in
providers they previously added.

:::info

Users can link their accounts only to social providers you configured in your Ory project.

:::

Users can use account linking and un-linking:

- to start signing in with a profile created in a social sign-in provider when they originally signed up with email and password
- to link another social sign-in provider to their profile so that they can sign in with their GitHub profile and their Facebook
  profile
- to remove a social sign-in provider link from the profile (possible only when multiple sign-in methods are available to prevent
  locking users out from accounts)

## Linking accounts

Users can link accounts manually through their account's settings page. To try out account linking, use the Ory Account
Experience. Follow these steps:

1. Configure at least two sign-up methods in your Ory project. One of these methods must be through a social sign-in provider.
2. Go to your project's Ory Account Experience at `https://{project.slug}.projects.oryapis.com/ui` and sign up.
3. After you sign up, go to **Account Settings** and navigate to the **Social Sign In** section.
4. Select one of the buttons to link an available social sign-in provider.

## Un-linking account

Users with multiple sign-in methods can un-link social sign-in providers from their account through their account's settings page.
To try out account un-linking, use the Ory Account Experience. Follow these steps:

1. Go to your project's Ory Account Experience at `https://{project.slug}.projects.oryapis.com/ui` and sign in with a user account
   with multiple sign-in methods available.
2. Go to **Account Settings** and navigate to the **Social Sign In** section.
3. Use the buttons to un-link a social sign-in provider.

## Automatic account linking

While it is convenient for users, automatic account linking creates an attack vector that can allow malicious actors to steal user
accounts.

:::warning

Since it constitutes a security threat, automatic account linking is not available in Ory.

:::

To better understand the danger, consider the following scenario:

- Your application allows users to create new accounts or sign in with ACME - a well-known social sign-in provider.
- John creates a new account in your application using his `john@doe.com` email.
- Malicious actors know that John uses `john@doe.com` to sign in to his account in your app.
- Malicious actors create an ACME account for `john@doe.com`.
- Malicious actors sign up in your application using the ACME account created for the `john@doe.com` account.
- Your system uses the default behavior and when it detects two accounts with the same identifier, malicious actors are asked to
  link the accounts.
- Malicious actors link the accounts.
- Malicious actors get access to the account that John created manually using his `john@doe.com` email.
