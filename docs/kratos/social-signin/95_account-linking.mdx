# Account linking

Ory supports three types of account linking:

- Manual account linking through account settings.
- Account linking during login with a social login or single sign on provider.
- Automatic account linking for imported users without additional user interaction.

Ory doesn't support automatic account linking for users who sign up with a social login provider. This is to prevent account
takeover attacks.

## Manual account linking

Ory allows users to link their accounts to social login providers after they signed up, as well as un-link social login providers
they previously added.

Users can link and unlink accounts:

- to start signing in with a profile created in a social login provider when they originally signed up with email and password
- to link another social login provider to their profile so that they can sign in with their GitHub profile and their Facebook
  profile
- to remove a social login provider link from the profile (possible only when multiple login methods are available to prevent
  locking users out from accounts)

### Link accounts

Users can link accounts manually through their account's settings page. To try out account linking, use the Ory Account
Experience. Follow these steps:

1. Configure at least two sign-up methods in your Ory project. One of these methods must be through a social login provider.
2. Go to your project's Ory Account Experience at `https://$PROJECT_SLUG.projects.oryapis.com/ui/registration` and sign up.
3. After you sign up, go to **Account Settings** and navigate to the **Social Sign In** section.
4. Select one of the buttons to link an available social login provider.

### Unlink accounts

Users with multiple login methods can unlink social login providers from their account through their account's settings page. To
try out account un-linking, use the Ory Account Experience. Follow these steps:

1. Go to your project's Ory Account Experience at `https://$PROJECT_SLUG.projects.oryapis.com/ui` and sign in with a user account
   with multiple login methods available.
2. Go to **Account Settings** and navigate to the **Social Sign In** section.
3. Use the buttons to unlink a social login provider.

## Account linking on login and registration

Users can link their accounts to social login providers during login or registration. This is useful when users sign up with a
social login provider and later want to link their account to another social login provider or to an email and password account:

1. The user creates an account with the identifier `alice@example.com`, which is also a verifiable address, and a login method
   such as a password or passkey.
1. When signing in later, the user signs in with a SSO login provider. That SSO account (through the OIDC userinfo endpoint or the
   ID token) returns a verified or unverified email of `alice@example.com`. Email verification is not required for this flow due
   to the verification step that follows (e.g. entering the password of the account to be merged).
1. Since the email address already exists, the user will be prompted to enter the password chosen in step 1.
1. After entering the correct password, the SSO provider is linked to the user's account. Now they can sign in with either
   password or SSO provider.

```

### Automatic account linking

In some migration scenarios, the legacy system may only store the email address of the SSO user, but not the subject identifier
typically used for performing SSO flows. To solve this migration case, automatic account linking can be used. This allows users to
sign in with a social login provider without having to enter their password, as long as the email address is verified and the
email address is already associated as a verifiable address with an account in Ory.

To enable automatic account linking for a specific user, import the user into Ory with the `oidc` credentials using the
[`createIdentity`](../../reference/api#tag/identity/operation/createIdentity) or
[`batchPatchIdentities`](../../reference/api#tag/identity/operation/batchPatchIdentities) API endpoints. The payload of an
individual identity would look like this:

```json {13-14}
{
  "schema_id": "preset://email",
  "traits": {
    "email": "docs-oidc@example.org"
    // Depending on your identity schema, you may include additional traits here
  },
  "credentials": {
    "oidc": {
      "config": {
        "providers": [
          {
            "provider": "github",
            "subject": "the-email@example.org",
            "use_auto_link": true
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Additionally, your Ory project must have the `use_auto_link` feature flag enabled. To enable it, please reach out to Ory support
or your account executive. This feature is only available for Ory Network or self-hosted enterprise customers.

## Account linking security considerations

Ory doesn't support fully automatic account linking when users sign up with a social login provider. This restriction is in place
to mitigate several classes of account takeover attacks. Even though automatic linking can improve UX, it opens up critical
security risks. Below are the threat models that justify this decision.

### Risks from verified email addresses

Automatic account linking typically relies on verified email addresses returned by social login providers. This isn't sufficient
to prove identity in many real-world cases:

#### Email domain control is not proof of identity

An attacker can register a domain like `acme.org` (e.g. because it expired) and configure an email `john.doe@acme.org`. If your
app uses automatic linking and trusts the email `john.doe@acme.org` as proof of identity, this attacker could take over an
existing user's account if they used the same email.

Even worse, many companies expose dangling CNAMEs or unused subdomains. If an attacker can hijack a subdomain (e.g.,
`email.acme.org`), they may also be able to receive email for `*@email.acme.org`, enabling targeted takeovers.

#### Email address re-use

Many identity systems—especially corporate IAMs or consumer-grade email providers—allow re-creating previously used email
addresses. For example:

- A former employee leaves and the company reassigns `jane.doe@company.com` to a new hire.
- A consumer email service recycles unused email addresses.

In both cases, a new person ends up with a previously owned address. If automatic linking were enabled based on the email alone,
the new person could gain access to the old user's account.

#### Inconsistent or unverified OIDC claims

Social login providers vary in how they handle and expose the `email_verified` claim. Some always set it to `true` even if they
haven't verified the email properly. Others provide partial or incomplete OIDC claims. Relying on these can create false trust in
identities.

Additionally, users can sometimes change their email address with the provider (e.g., Google, GitHub) without re-verification,
which invalidates the previous link’s integrity.

#### Summary of security risks

| Threat              | Description                                            | Risk                   |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Domain spoofing     | Attacker controls domain or subdomain to receive email | Full account takeover  |
| Email re-use        | Providers or companies recycle email addresses         | Unauthorized access    |
| Weak identity proof | OIDC claims may be unverified or modifiable            | False identity linking |
| Dangling DNS        | Subdomains with CNAME takeovers enable abuse           | Malicious registration |

#### Ory’s security model

To avoid these risks:

- Ory requires an additional verification step, like password or passkey input, before linking a new login method.
- Automatic account linking is only allowed for pre-provisioned identities where you explicitly configure the trusted linkage
  using the `use_auto_link` flag via the API.
- The `use_auto_link` feature isn't enabled by default and only available for Ory Network and Enterprise customers after security
  evaluation.

##### Conditions for safe automatic linking

Some identity providers enforce stricter identity guarantees and may be considered for automatic account linking in the future
under a feature flag. These providers must meet several criteria:

- Strong verification of email ownership: The `email_verified` claim must be reliably set only after a secure email verification
  process.
- No email address reuse: Once an email address has been used, it must never be reassigned to another user.
- Trusted domains: The provider must control and protect its domains (e.g., `gmail.com`, `icloud.com`) and prevent misuse via
  dangling subdomains or unowned DNS entries.
- Immutable identifiers: Changes to the user's email address must not silently affect the linked identity without re-verification
  or user intent.

Examples of providers that are likely to meet these standards include:

- Google (Gmail): Strong domain control, verified email, and no email recycling.
- Apple (iCloud): Verified identities and strict lifecycle policies.

Ory is evaluating support for automatic account linking under a feature flag for selected, well-defined providers that meet these
security conditions.

### Troubleshooting

#### Hide irrelevant authentication methods

Depending on the use case it might be required to show all configured authentication methods to the user. This can be confusing
for users who have accounts with different authentication methods.

To prevent confusion and hide authentication methods that aren't configured for the user, enable
[login hints](../../identities/sign-in/login-hint.mdx). Login hints inform users about the authentication methods available for
the existing account.
