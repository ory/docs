# Link and unlink social sign in providers

This document explains how to link and unlink social sign in to and from existing user accounts. Account linking is required for
three main use cases:

- Users signed up with email and password can link a social sign in provider to their account.
- Users signed up using a social sign in provider (for example GitHub) can add another social sign in provider (for example
  Google) to their account.
- Users can remove a social sign in provider from their account. To prevent users from locking themselves out of their account,
  unlinking is only possible if the user has multiple sign in methods configured.

## Perform account linking

Linking accounts is an operation that users must perform manually from their account settings.

1. Set up at least two methods for users to sign up, for example password and GitHub, in your project.
2. Sign up with a test account in your project using a password.
3. In the managed account experience, navigate to your account settings.
4. Click **Link GitHub** under social sign in.

## Unlink account

A user with two ways of signing in, for example password and GitHub, has the following steps to perform:

1. Log in to your project.
2. In the managed account experience, navigate to the account settings.
3. Click **Unlink GitHub** under social sign in.

## Automatic account linking

While convenient for users, automatic account linking creates an attack vector that can allow malicious actors to steal user
accounts.

:::warning

Since it constitutes a security threat, automatic account linking is not available in Ory.

:::

To better understand the danger, consider the following scenario:

- Your application allows users to create new accounts or sign in with ACME - a well-known social sign-in provider.
- John creates a new account in your application using his `john@doe.com` email.
- Malicious actors know that John uses `john@doe.com` to sign in to his account in your app.
- Malicious actors create an ACME account for `john@doe.com`.
- Malicious actors sign up in your application using the ACME account created for the `john@doe.com` account.
- Your system uses the default behavior and when it detects two accounts with the same identifier, malicious actors are asked to
  link the accounts.
- Malicious actors link the accounts.
- Malicious actors get access to the account that John created manually using his `john@doe.com` email.
