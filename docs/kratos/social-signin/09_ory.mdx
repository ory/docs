title: Add Ory OAuth2 or Ory Hydra as a social sign-in provider
sidebar_label: Ory

# Ory

This **Ory** option allows you to add Ory OAuth2 as OIDC provider. In Ory Network, you can create this provider using the Ory
Console or the Ory CLI. When self-hosting Ory, deploy the Ory Hydra Federation server and use the `hydra` CLI to create the
client.

The following snippet shows how to create it using the CLI:

```bash
ory create project --name "OAuth2 Server - Example Corp"
# Note down the project ID
export project_id=your-project-id # replace with your project ID

ory create oauth2-client --project $project_id \
 --name "Example Corp" \
 --grant-type authorization_code,refresh_token \
 --response-type code \
 --scope openid,offline_access,email \
 --redirect-uri https://your-project-slug.projects.oryapis.com/self-service/methods/oidc/callback/H1o_k--i # replace with your redirect URI
```

If you want to learn more head over to the [Ory OAuth2](../../oauth2-oidc/index.md) documentation.

To add your Ory OAuth2 server as a social sign-in provider, you need these details:

- Client ID - you get this when creating the client
- Client Secret - you get this when creating the client
- Issuer URL - this is the URL of the Ory Network project or Ory Hydra Federation server instance.

Follow these steps to add an Ory OAuth2 provider to your project using the Ory Console:

1. Sign in to Ory Console and select [**Social Sign-in**](https://console.ory.sh/projects/current/social-signin).
2. Click the **Add new OpenID Connect provider** button.
3. Define the **Label**. This name is used for identification purposes only.
4. Paste the configuration details obtained from your social sign-in provider into the corresponding fields in the Console:
   - Client ID
   - Client Secret
   - Issuer URL
5. Copy the Redirect URI from the Console and add it to the OAuth2 client you created earlier. You can do this in the Ory
   Console or using the Ory CLI.
6. Click **Save Configuration** to finish.

:::note

These steps cover the basic configuration of a social sign-in provider integration. At this point, the user experience is
incomplete. To complete the configuration and ensure a smooth and secure user experience, configure the [scopes](#scopes) and
[data mapping](#data-mapping) as described in the next section.

:::

## Additional configuration

When adding a generic social sign-in provider, you can customize the integration by defining the OAuth scopes Ory requests from
the provider and by setting up custom data mappings.

### Scopes

The Scopes section allows you to define the OAuth scopes Ory requests from the sign-in provider. Defining scopes allows you to
interact with the provider's APIs on behalf of the user, or to access additional user data, which is exposed as claims for data
mapping.

For an out of the box setup, use the default scopes `openid`, `offline_access` and `email`.

### Data mapping

In the **Data Mapping** field of the form in the Ory Console, add the following Jsonnet code snippet,
which maps the desired claims to the Ory Identity schema:

```jsonnet
local claims = {
  email_verified: false,
} + std.extVar('claims');

{
  identity: {
    traits: {
      // Allowing unverified email addresses enables account
      // enumeration attacks,  if the value is used for
      // verification or as a password login identifier.
      //
      // Therefore we only return the email if it (a) exists and (b) is marked verified.
      [if 'email' in claims && claims.email_verified then 'email' else null]: claims.email,
    },
  },
}
```

```mdx-code-block
<JsonnetWarning format="Jsonnet code snippets" use="data mapping" />
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="cli" label="Ory CLI">

Follow these steps to add a Ory as a social sign-in provider to your project using the Ory CLI:

1. Create a client with Ory OAuth2 as described above to get a Client ID and Client Secret.
2. Create a [Jsonnet code snippet](#data-mapping) to map the desired claims to the Ory Identity schema, such as:
```jsonnet
local claims = {
  email_verified: false,
} + std.extVar('claims');

{
  identity: {
    traits: {
      // Allowing unverified email addresses enables account
      // enumeration attacks,  if the value is used for
      // verification or as a password login identifier.
      //
      // Therefore we only return the email if it (a) exists and (b) is marked verified.
      [if 'email' in claims && claims.email_verified then 'email' else null]: claims.email,
    },
  },
}
```
3. Encode the Jsonnet snippet with [Base64](https://www.base64encode.org/) or host it under an URL accessible to Ory Network.
4. Download the Ory Identities config from your project and save it to a file:

   ```shell
   ## List all available projects
   ory list projects

   ## Get config
   ory get identity-config {project-id} --format yaml > identity-config.yaml
   ```

5. Add the social sign-in provider configuration to the downloaded config. Add the Jsonnet snippet with mappings as a Base64
   string or provide an URL to the file.

   ```yaml
   selfservice:
     methods:
       oidc:
         config:
           providers:
             - id: yourid # this is `<provider-id>` in the Authorization callback URL. DO NOT CHANGE IT ONCE SET!
               provider: generic
               client_id: .... # Replace this with the Client ID
               client_secret: .... # Replace this with the Client secret
               issuer_url: https://your-project-slug.projects.oryapis.com # Replace this with the providers issuer URL
               mapper_url: "base64://{YOUR_BASE64_ENCODED_JSONNET_HERE}"
               # Alternatively, use an URL:
               # mapper_url: https://storage.googleapis.com/abc-cde-prd/9cac9717f007808bf17f22ce7f4295c739604b183f05ac4afb4
               scope:
                 - email
                 - offline_access
                 - openid
               # supported scopes can be found in your providers dev docs
         enabled: true
   ```

6. Update the Ory Identities configuration using the file you worked with:

   ```shell
   ory update identity-config {project-id} --file identity-config.yaml
   ```
