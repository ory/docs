# Decision guide: Custom vs. Built-in UI

Ory provides multiple options for integrating user interfaces (UI) with your applications. This guide helps you decide when to use
a custom UI versus the built-in Ory Account Experience UI.

## Understanding the Options

Ory offers three main approaches for integrating UIs:

```mdx-code-block
import { elementsArchitectureGraph, axArchitectureGraph, customArchitectureGraph } from "@site/src/pages/_assets/ui-graphs"
import Mermaid from "@site/src/theme/Mermaid"
```

### Option 1: Built-in Ory Account Experience UI

The Ory Account Experience UI is a fully customizable, out-of-the-box solution that allows you to integrate essential user flows
like login, registration, and account management without the need to design and code your own UI. It dynamically adjusts to
changes in your project configuration, such as adding new social sign-in providers, and can be customized to match your brand
using the tools available in the Ory Console.

<Mermaid chart={axArchitectureGraph} />

**When to choose:** This option is ideal for most use cases, especially if you want to quickly integrate Ory into your
application.

### Option 2: Custom User Interface with Ory Elements

For more advanced use cases, Ory Elements provides a component library that allows you to build custom user interfaces for Ory
self-service flows. It includes pre-built components that can be easily integrated into your application, enabling you to create a
seamless user experience while leveraging Ory's powerful authentication and identity management capabilities. It provides the same
theming options, and additionally allows you to override specific components of the UI to match your brand and user experience
requirements.

Currently only available for React.

<Mermaid chart={elementsArchitectureGraph} />

**When to choose:** This option is suitable if you want to build a custom UI while in a React application, but don't want to start
from scratch.

### Option 3: Custom User Interface with Ory SDKs

The most advanced option is to build a custom user interface using Ory SDKs. This approach gives you the highest level of control
over the user experience and allows you to implement complex business logic. However, it requires a deeper understanding of Ory's
APIs and flows, and it may take more time to implement compared to the other options.

**When to choose:** This option is ideal for complex applications that require a high level of customization and control over the
user experience.
