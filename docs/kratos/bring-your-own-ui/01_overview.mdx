Ory is designed to allow you to easily implement custom user interfaces (UI) for browser and native applications thanks to
simple-to-use headless API flows.

In addition to that, Ory Network comes with a flexible and customizable UI out of the box. Ory Account Experience allows you to
integrate all of the essential flows, such as login or registration, without the need to dedicate time or resources to designing
and coding UI on your own.

Even though it's tempting to start building a custom UI right away, we recommend you start your journey with Ory using the Account
Experience, which is a battle-tested solution that provides a great starting point for integrating your application with the Ory
Network.

## Why should I use Ory Account Experience?

Ory Account Experience is the out-of-the-box UI that comes with every Ory Network project, on all available plans. It allows you
to start using Ory without the need to understand the APIs in detail. With Ory Account Experience, your UI adjusts dynamically to
reflect the changes in your project configuration, such as adding new social sign-in connectors. You can also make the look of the
Account Experience UI match your brand using the customization tools available in the Ory Console.

To see the Ory Account Experience in action and customize the views, go to the **Overview** and **Theming** views of the **Account
Experience** section in the Ory Console.

## Why should I build a custom UI?

Building a custom UI allows you to get the highest level of integration with your business requirements and have the ultimate
control over the user experience.

The best way to start building a custom UI is to use the provided Ory examples and tooling, since this will shorten the time to
market and allow you to focus on your application's business logic.

### Ory Elements

The Ory Elements component library is a great way to get started with your own UI as it provides a set of drop-in components that
automatically map Ory provided flow data to the UI. It handles all UI mapping for authentication flows such as `login`,
`registration`, `settings`, `verification` and `recovery`. Ory Elements is designed to work with your business logic, which means
that you can decide how to handle API calls to Ory and how the data resulting from these calls is managed in your application.

To learn how to use Ory Elements and see a sample implementation, read
[Custom UI with Ory Elements](./15_custom-ui-ory-elements.mdx).
