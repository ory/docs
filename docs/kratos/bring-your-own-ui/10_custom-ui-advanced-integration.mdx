This document goes into detail on advanced topics in specific use cases after you have already integrated a basic user interface.
The topics range from advanced redirects to passwordless and two-factor authentication. Read the
[Basic integration](./05_custom-ui-basic-integration.mdx) document first to learn about flows and methods.

## Advanced redirects

Most applications that use Ory need advanced URL redirects. For example, the application might have a page where the user is
redirected when their session expires. After the user re-authenticates, they should be redirected to the page they were using when
their session expired.

To achieve this, the application can pass a `?return_to=<url>` query parameter to the endpoint that initializes a flow:
[`/self-service/{flow_type}/browser?return_to=https://myapp.com/protected`](../../reference/api#tag/frontend).

The `return_to` URL is the redirect URL after the flow is completed. For example with a login flow the redirect happens after a
successful login.

This is a breakdown of how the redirect works:

1. Initialize the flow with a `return_to` URL.
2. Use the flow data to render the UI.
3. Submit the flow with user data.
4. If the flow is successful, the user is redirected to the URL defined in the `return_to` parameter.

The `return_to` query parameter doesn't automatically persist across different flows and must be added to new flows. For example,
if the user starts a login flow with `return_to` URL set and then switches to a registration flow, the `return_to` URL isn't used
for the registration flow. In such a case, your application can re-use the same `return_to` from the login flow by extracting the
`return_to` URL from the login flow's `flow.return_to` and adding it to the registration flow.

```ts
sdk.getLoginFlow({ id: flow }).then(({ data: flow }) => {
  const returnTo = flow.return_to
  return sdk.createBrowserRegistrationFlow({
    id: flow.id,
    return_to: returnTo,
  })
})
```

The `return_to` URL persists across flows only when a recovery flow transitions into a the settings flow.

Take a look at an example of how this works:

1. Create a recovery flow with `return_to`.
2. Email is sent with a `link` or `code` method.
3. User completes the recovery flow by submitting the `code` or clicking the `link`.
4. The user gets a sessions and is redirected through the `settings` flow.
5. The user submits the `settings` flow with an updated password.
6. The user is redirected to the `return_to` URL.

## Login

### Refreshing user session

To re-authenticate an active user session and confirm the same user is logged in, the application implementing the UI can request
Ory to force the user to authenticate again through the `?refresh=true` query parameter. To do that, call the
[`/self-service/login/browser?refresh=true`](../../reference/api#tag/frontend/operation/createBrowserLoginFlow) endpoint. This is
only applicable to the login flow and requires the user to already have a session.

This is a common use case for refreshing a session:

1. User logs in.
2. User interacts with the application.
3. User is inactive for a period of time.
4. The user returns before session lifespan expires.
5. The application needs to confirm that the user interacting with the application is the same user that logged in.
6. The session is refreshed through a login flow with the `?refresh=true` query parameter.

```ts
sdk.createBrowserLoginFlow({ refresh: true })
```

### Social sign-in

When using social sign-in, the user must be redirected using a native form POST. In single-page applications the page is never
redirected. For the application to then have a background POST on other methods such as `password`, the application must separate
the flow data across two forms.

```tsx
{/*This form will do a native post request to Ory for the selected provider*/}
<form action={flow.action} method={flow.method}>
    <button type="submit" value="google">Sign in with Google</button>
    <button type="submit" value="facebook">Sign in with Facebook</button>
</form>

<form action={flow.action} method={flow.method} onSubmit={submitHandler}>
    {/*Map the other flow groups here such as `default` and `password`*/}
</form>
```

#### Upstream provider parameters

Sometimes it's possible to pass more parameters to the upstream provider. For example, when using the Google provider, it's
possible to pass the `login_hint`, `hd` and `prompt` parameters.

The `login_hint` parameter suppresses the account chooser and either pre-fills the email box on the sign-in form, or selects the
proper session. The `hd` parameter limits the login/registration process to a Google Organization, for example `mycollege.edu`.
The `prompt` parameter specifies whether the Authorization Server prompts the End-User for reauthentication and consent, for
example `select_account`. To pass these parameters on `login`, `registration` and `settings` flows, the application can use the
submit form body to pass the parameters. For example:

```html
<form action="https://$PROJECT_SLUG.projects.oryapis.com/self-service/login?flow=<flow-id>" method="POST">
  <input type="submit" name="provider" value="google" />
  <input type="hidden" name="upstream_parameters.login_hint" value="foo@bar.com" />
  <input type="hidden" name="upstream_parameters.hd" value="bar.com" />
  <input type="hidden" name="upstream_parameters.prompt" value="select_account" />
  <input type="hidden" name="upstream_parameters.auth_type" value="reauthenticate" />
</form>
```

:::note

Supported parameters: `login_hint`, `hd`, `prompt`, and `auth_type`.

### Two-factor authentication

Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a second step used to confirm the user's identity. When creating a login flow, you can specify
the `?aal=<level>` query parameter to specify the required level of authentication: `aal1` or `aal2`.

To initialize the second authentication factor, the user must already have a valid session cookie. The
[`/sessions/whoami`](../../reference/api#tag/frontend/operation/toSession) endpoint returns an error with the
`session_aal2_required` ID if the user is required to complete a second factor.

```ts
sdk
  .toSession()
  .then(({ data: session }) => {
    // set the session data which contains the user Identifier and other traits.
  })
  .catch((err: AxiosError) => {
    switch (error.response?.status) {
      case 403: {
        // the user might have a session, but would require 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication)
        if (error.response?.data.error?.id === "session_aal2_required") {
          navigate("/login?aal2=true", { replace: true })
          return
        }
      }
    }
  })
```

### Passwordless authentication

Passwordless authentication uses the WebAuthn specification to authenticate users with hardware keys, biometrics, or passkeys.

For an application to use WebAuthn, add the
[`/.well-known/ory/webauthn.js`](../../reference/api#tag/frontend/operation/getWebAuthnJavaScript) WebAuthn JavaScript to the
page. Ory provides the on-click handler for the button to start the passwordless authentication flow.

The flow works as follows:

1. Create login flow.
2. Render the UI with the `webauthn` group.
3. User enters their identifier and clicks the `Sign in with security key` button.
4. The form is submitted which starts a new flow with the `webauthn` group.
5. Render the new UI which prompts the user to insert their security key.
6. The user inserts their security key and clicks the `Continue` button.

```html
<head>
  <script src="/.well-known/ory/webauthn.js"></script>
</head>
```

````mdx-code-block
<Tabs groupId="webauthn">

<TabItem value="ts" label="React" default>

```mdx-code-block
import webAuthnMapping from '!!raw-loader!../../../code-examples/sdk/typescript/src/ui/webauthn-mapping.tsx'

<CodeBlock language="tsx">{webAuthnMapping}</CodeBlock>
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>
````

This is an example response from the login flow with passwordless authentication enabled. This is the first step of the flow where
the user enters their identifier.

```json5
{
  ui: {
    nodes: [
      {
        type: "input",
        group: "webauthn",
        attributes: {
          name: "method",
          type: "submit",
          value: "webauthn",
          disabled: false,
          node_type: "input",
        },
        messages: [],
        meta: {
          label: {
            id: 1010001,
            text: "Sign in with security key",
            type: "info",
            context: {},
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  },
}
```

After the user is redirected with a new flow, the response contains just the `webauthn` group. In this response, the button
`onclick` attribute calls the script added in the header/body of the page. The button then triggers the WebAuthn prompt for the
security key.

```json5
{
  ui: {
    nodes: [
      {
        type: "input",
        group: "webauthn",
        attributes: {
          name: "webauthn_login_trigger",
          type: "button",
          value: "",
          disabled: false,
          onclick: 'window.__oryWebAuthnLogin({"publicKey":{"challenge":"LLoTYU0Xv7QkmIFiwKDOpr1XeNU5c0TGnCgzj6kqSIQ=","timeout":60000,"rpId":"auth.example.com","allowCredentials":[{"type":"public-key","id":"3DUZPEd3DwUCaRkyTy0L0MntQElA0AH4uAUydiVhBdGWTXHS1TDsY+lgHRhTj52cFUL/uua2Af+dgqD14a/rHA=="}],"userVerification":"discouraged"}})',
          node_type: "input",
        },
        messages: [],
        meta: {
          label: {
            id: 1010013,
            text: "Continue",
            type: "info",
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  },
}
```

#### SPAs and the '422' error

A response code `422` indicates that the browser needs to be redirected with a newly created flow. Since this is an SPA, the new
flow ID can be extracted from the payload and the response can be retrieved in the background instead of a redirect.

This is an example code `422` error:

```json5
{
  error: {
    id: "browser_location_change_required",
    code: 422,
    status: "Unprocessable Entity",
    reason: "In order to complete this flow please redirect the browser to: /ui/login?flow=ad574ad7-1a3c-4b52-9f54-ef9e866f3cec",
    message: "browser location change required",
  },
  redirect_browser_to: "/ui/login?flow=ad574ad7-1a3c-4b52-9f54-ef9e866f3cec",
}
```
