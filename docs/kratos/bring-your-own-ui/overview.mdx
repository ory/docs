Ory has been built with customization in mind through its simple to use headless API flows. This allows for easy integration, may
it be with browser or native applications. Even though it is tempting to immediately start building your own UI, we recommend to
first start with the provided UIs as they are battle tested and provide a great starting point for your journey with Ory.

## Why should I use the provided UIs?

Ory provides an out-of-the-box UI called the Account Experience with every Ory project, no matter if it is a free or paid tier.
This allows for you to immediately start using Ory without having to understand the Ory APIs in detail. The Account Experience is
already battle tested and provides a great set of customizability options. The customizations are done through the Ory Console or
Ory CLI and are applied to the Account Experience automatically. You can even theme the Account Experience to match your brand!

## Why should I build my own UI?

A custom user interface allows for a better user experience with a tight integration with your business requirements. This allows
for you to cater to your users' needs and have full control of the user experience. The best way to start is by using the provided
tooling, since this will shorten the time to market and allow you to focus on your application business logic.

[Ory Elements](./custom-ui-ory-elements) is a great way to get started with your own UI as it provides a set of drop-in components
that automatically map Ory provided flow data to the UI. It handles all the UI mapping for the authentication flows such as
`login`, `registration`, `verification`, `recovery` and `settings` for you, but does not get in the way of how you want to manage
the data retrieval and logic from Ory in your application.

To get started with Ory Elements, take a look at the [Custom UI Ory Elements](./custom-ui-ory-elements) guide.

## What are the next steps?

Understand the fundamentals of the Ory APIs with the [Basic Integration](./custom-ui-basic-integration) document.
