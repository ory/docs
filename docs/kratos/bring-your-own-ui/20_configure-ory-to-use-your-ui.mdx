title: Configure Ory to use your UI
---

To define the paths where Ory calls your custom UI, go to <ConsoleLink route="project.ui" />. This view allows you to define the
URLs of UI views for every self-service flow. To point to the desired UI, you can use relative or absolute paths.

:::info

Unless you set a custom UI base URL, relative links always use your SDK Configuration URL as the base. To get your project's SDK
Configuration URL, go to <ConsoleLink route="project.settings" />, and copy the URL from the **API Endpoints** field.

:::

By default, self-service flows use [Ory Account Experience](./01_overview.mdx#why-should-i-use-ory-account-experience), which is a
part of every Ory Network project. In the default setup, the system uses relative paths to point to the appropriate UI for every
screen. The relative links that point to the Ory Account Experience follow the `/ui/{flow_name}` format.

## Custom domain setup

All paid Ory Network plans allow to add a custom domain to your project. After adding a custom domain, you can also set up a base
URL of all custom UI views. This is a great way to make Ory work with your existing deployment without adjustments, as you can use
the combination of the base URL and relative URLs to point Ory to UI screens for operations such as login or registration you are
already hosting.

To set the base URL of custom UI and define the paths for UI views, go to <ConsoleLink route="project.ui" />.

:::caution

When you define a custom UI base URL, you lose access to the Ory Account Experience. The custom UI base url takes precedence over
SDK Configuration URL.

:::

You can toggle the "Enable the Account Experience welcome page" setting to hide the default "welcome" screen that isn't intended
for end-users.

## Multiple custom domains

With the Multibrand feature enabled for your workspace, you can add multiple custom domains to each Ory Network project. You can
add a different custom UI base URL of each of the custom domains registered in the project. This allows for a high degree of
flexibility, where each of the domains serves its own set of UI views that have a common path makeup but different base URL.

```mdx-code-block
import Help from '@site/docs/_common/need-help.mdx'

<Help/>
```

In practical terms, this means that you can serve different UI views to customers that interact with different parts of your
business, while still allowing them to conveniently use one account that's managed by your Ory Network project.

For example, the ACME Car Parts company has three online storefronts for three different types of automotive products:

- mufflers.com
- carseats.com
- wipers.com

Since all the storefronts are managed and developed by one company, they all serve their UI at the same path, which is
`/acme/ui/{flow_name}`. But as the apps were developed at different points in time, the team's approach to hosting changed and
influenced the base paths used for serving UI:

- mufflers.com uses `mufflers.com/auth`
- carseats.com uses `carseats.com`
- wipers.com uses `wipers.com/self-service/`

ACME creates this setup at <ConsoleLink route="project.accountExperience.theming" />.

| Website      | Custom Domain    | Cookie Domain | Custom UI Base URL       |
| ------------ | ---------------- | ------------- | ------------------------ |
| mufflers.com | ory.mufflers.com | mufflers.com  | mufflers.com/auth        |
| carseats.com | ory.carseats.com | carseats.com  | carseats.com             |
| wipers.com   | ory.wipers.com   | wipers.com    | wipers.com/self-service/ |

This way, ACME users who create an account in one of these stores can use it to shop in the other stores as well. The UI ACME
serves changes depending on the store the user visits which allows for consistency with the established visual identity of each of
ACME's brands. Since these stores are hosted on different domains, the users must sign in and get an Ory Session issued for the
store's domain when they switch between the storefronts.

It's important to note that while a user can use the same account across multiple domains, they will need to authenticate
separately on each domain. This is because cookies, including the session cookie issued by Ory, are isolated in the browser per
domain to prevent cross-site attacks. Therefore, there will be one session per domain. As an alternative for managing multiple
domains, you can use OpenID Connect. However, even with OpenID Connect, there will still be one session per domain.

## Development

When developing locally, you can configure Ory Network to use UI views hosted on local machine, for example
`http://localhost:1234/login`.

To do that, use [Ory Tunnel](../../guides/cli/20_proxy-and-tunnel.mdx) to create a connection between your local environment and
Ory Network and configure the system to accept `http://localhost:1234/` as part of the same domain as your project.

:::note

Use Ory Tunnel just for development purposes. When you go to production, always add a custom domain to your project.
