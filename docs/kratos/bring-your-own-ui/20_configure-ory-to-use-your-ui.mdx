title: Configure Ory to use your UI
---

Unless you are building a native app, you must configure the endpoints where your UI pages for the individual flows are located.

To define the endpoints where Ory should look for your custom UI, go to [**Ory Console**](https://console.ory.sh/) â†’ **User
Interface**. If you don't define any of the endpoints, Ory Account Experience will be used for that flow.

Let's say you have an app hosted at `https://www.example.org` with a login screen at `https://www.example.org/login` but you don't
have other screens implemented yet. It's okay! Provide the login UI endpoint and leave the other endpoints untouched to use Ory
Account Experience.

## Development

When developing locally, you can set the configuration to, for example, `http://localhost:1234/login`. To make this work, you will
use [Ory Tunnel](../../guides/cli/proxy-and-tunnel). Read [Developing with Ory](../../getting-started/local-development.mdx) to
learn more.

## Reference implementations and examples

There are several reference implementations and guides available for building your own user interface and forms on top of Ory's
APIs:

- [Add Custom Login, Registration, User Settings to Your Next.js & React Single Page Application (SPA)](https://www.ory.sh/nextjs-authentication-spa-custom-flows-open-source/)
- [Node.js / Express.js UI Reference Implementation](https://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-node)
- [React Native UI Reference Implementation](https://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-react-native)
