# Identity metadata & traits

Identities have traits and metadata:

- **Traits** are attributes of an identity, that can be updated by the identity owner, for example the username or email address.
- **Metadata** are attributes defined by the system admin that can't be updated or modified by the identity owner. The only way to
  update the metadata is through the `/admin/identities` APIs. These fields can store additional information, such as the original
  sign up date if the identity was created through a migration. Other common use cases include for example storing a user's
  subscription status, legacy user ID, or basic roles.

## Metadata

There are two types of identity metadata:

- **Public:** Attributes that can only be modified using the `/admin/identities` APIs. They are visible to anyone having access to
  the user's sessions, for example by calling `toSession()` or `/sessions/whoami`. This allows you to access the metadata in the
  frontend without calling the admin APIs.
- **Admin:** Attributes that can only be modified and read using the `/admin/identities` APIs.

:::note

Metadata is not validated using the identity's JSON schema. You must ensure that the metadata you store is valid according to your
schema and you must keep the schema up to date to accommodate changes in the data.

:::

To manage metadata, use the following APIs:

- [`POST /admin/identities`](../../reference/api.mdx#operation/createIdentity)
- [`GET /admin/identities`](../../reference/api.mdx#operation/listIdentities)
- [`GET /admin/identities/{id}`](../../reference/api.mdx#operation/getIdentity)
- [`PUT /admin/identities/{id}`](../../reference/api.mdx#operation/updateIdentity)

:::info

You need an API Key to call these endpoints. Read [Authorization with API Keys](../../concepts/personal-access-token.mdx) to learn
more.

## Traits

Traits are the data associated with an identity. This data can be modified by the identity owner, for example at sign up or in the
profile update process. Identity traits can also be modified by users with Ory Identities (Kratos) Admin API access.

:::note

Ory Identities (Kratos) uses [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/learn/getting-started-step-by-step.html) to validate Identity
traits.

:::

Each identity can, theoretically, have a different JSON Schema. This can be useful in the following situations:

- There is more than one type of identity in the system for example: customers, support, staff.
- The system includes both human users and "robots" (sometimes also known as named service accounts).
- The system needs to ingest another company's Identity Schema.
- The system's Identity Schema changes or grows over time and requires versioning.

This example illustrates a usage scenario with three types of identities: regular customers,
[grandfather accounts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandfather_clause), and service accounts (for example a Microsoft
[Service Account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/access-control/service-accounts)). Each
identity has one JSON schema that defines it:

- Customers: `http://mydomain.com/schemas/v2/customer.schema.json`
- Grandfather Accounts: `http://mydomain.com/schemas/v1/customer.schema.json`
- Service Accounts: `http://mydomain.com/schemas/service-account.schema.json`

Ory Identities expects the JSON Schemas in its configuration file:

```yaml
identity:
  # This will be the default JSON Schema. If `schema_id` is empty when creating an identity using the
  # Admin API or a user signs up using a selfservice flow, this schema will be used.
  #
  # This is a required configuration field!
  default_schema_id: person

  # Optionally define additional schemas here:
  schemas:
    # When creating an identity that uses this schema, `traits_schema_id: customer` are set for that identity.
    - id: customer
      url: http://foo.bar.com/customer.schema.json
    - id: person
      url: http://foo.bar.com/person.schema.json
```

Ory validates the identity traits against the corresponding schema on all "write" operations (create/update). The employed
business logic must be able to distinguish these three types of identities. You might use a switch statement like in the following
example:

```go
// This is an example program that can deal with all three types of identities
session, err := ory.SessionFromRequest(r)
// some error handling
switch (session.Identity.SchemaID) {
    case "customer":
        // ...
    case "employee":
        // ...
    case "default":
        fallthrough
    default:
        // ...
}
```
