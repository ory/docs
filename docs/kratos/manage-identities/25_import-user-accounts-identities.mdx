# Import identities

Ory allows you to import identities from any other system. The endpoint used is the same as when
[creating identities](./create-users-identities) with the subtle difference that you also provide the `credentials` field.

## Importing verified addresses

Use the `verifiable_addresses` field to import a verified address like an email address.

:::warning

You must ensure that address verification is enabled and that the `verifiable_address` is present in the identity's traits. If the
identity traits do not have the address set as the "verified address" type, the imported values will be deleted on the next
identity update.

:::

An exemplary payload for importing an identity with a verified address:

```json {4,8-11}
{
  "schema_id": "preset://email",
  "traits": {
    "email": "docs-verify@example.org"
  },
  "verifiable_addresses": [
    {
      "value": "docs-verify@example.org",
      "verified": true,
      "via": "email",
      "status": "completed"
    }
  ]
}
```

Test the above example with a cURL command:

````mdx-code-block
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs'
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem'
import SelfHostedKratos from '@site/src/components/SelfHostedKratos'

<Tabs
  defaultValue="cloud"
  values={[
    {label: 'The Ory Network', value: 'cloud'},
    {label: 'Self-Hosted Ory Kratos', value: 'kratos'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="cloud">

```shell
curl --request POST -sL \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer ory_pat_xRKLsFEOUFQFVBjd6o3FQDifaLYhabGd" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{
  "schema_id": "preset://email",
  "traits": {
    "email": "docs-verify@example.org"
  },
  "verifiable_addresses": [
    {
      "value": "docs-verify@example.org",
      "verified": true,
      "via": "email",
      "status": "completed"
    }
  ]
}' https://playground.projects.oryapis.com/admin/identities
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="kratos">
    <SelfHostedKratos/>

And use it to create an identity:

```shell
curl --request POST -sL \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{
  "schema_id": "preset://email",
  "traits": {
    "email": "docs-verify@example.org"
  },
  "verifiable_addresses": [
    {
      "value": "docs-verify@example.org",
      "verified": true,
      "via": "email",
      "status": "completed"
    }
  ]
}' http://127.0.0.1:4434/identities
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
````

The API then responds with the created identity:

```json {13-15}
{
  "id": "880052ae-d32c-4b56-b82d-0dc711080910",
  "schema_id": "preset://email",
  "schema_url": "http://localhost:4455/schemas/cHJlc2V0Oi8vZW1haWw",
  "state": "active",
  "state_changed_at": "2022-02-24T15:33:17.845589803Z",
  "traits": {
    "email": "docs-verify@example.org"
  },
  "verifiable_addresses": [
    {
      "id": "c3f67b59-ab58-410b-971a-06b80f38468a",
      "value": "docs-verify@example.org",
      "verified": true,
      "via": "email",
      "status": "completed",
      "created_at": "2022-02-24T15:33:17.848941Z",
      "updated_at": "2022-02-24T15:33:17.848941Z"
    }
  ],
  "recovery_addresses": [
    {
      "id": "819b53bf-79e3-452e-8a9b-0323ec9d193c",
      "value": "docs-verify@example.org",
      "via": "email",
      "created_at": "2022-02-24T15:33:17.849758Z",
      "updated_at": "2022-02-24T15:33:17.849758Z"
    }
  ],
  "created_at": "2022-02-24T15:33:17.848475Z",
  "updated_at": "2022-02-24T15:33:17.848475Z"
}
```

## Importing recovery addresses

It is possible to import a list of `recovery_addresses` - similar to `verifiable_addresses`. It is better to let the identity
schema handle setting the appropriate fields since there is no status to set for this address type.

We do not recommend setting these fields as they will be overwritten by other self-service flows! For more information on account
recovery please head over to the [account recovery documentation](../self-service/flows/account-recovery-password-reset.mdx).

## Importing credentials

Ory supports importing credentials for identities including passwords and social sign in. You can use all of these payloads with
the `curl` command from above!

### Clear text password

To import a clear text password, provide the password in the JSON payload.

:::warning

Password imports do not use any password validation. Users have to update their password according to the policy themselves using
self-service flows.

:::

```json {6-12}
{
  "schema_id": "preset://email",
  "traits": {
    "email": "docs-cleartext@example.org"
  },
  "credentials": {
    "password": {
      "config": {
        "password": "the-password"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The password `the-password` will then be hashed according to the configured password hashing algorithm and stored in the database.
The identity will be able to sign in using `docs-cleartext@example.org` and `the-password` as credentials.

### Hashed passwords

To import a hashed password, provide the hashed password in the JSON payload.

```json {6-12}
{
  "schema_id": "preset://email",
  "traits": {
    "email": "docs-hash@example.org"
  },
  "credentials": {
    "password": {
      "config": {
        "hashed_password": "$2a$10$ZsCsoVQ3xfBG/K2z2XpBf.tm90GZmtOqtqWcB5.pYd5Eq8y7RlDyq"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### BCrypt

Ory Identities can hash passwords by BCrypt and can compare stored BCrypt hash and migrate if configured hasher
(`hashers.algorithm`) isn't BCrypt.

#### Format

BCrypt format is described [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt#Description).

### Argon2

Ory Identities can hash passwords by Argon2 and can compare stored Argon2 hash and migrate if configured hasher
(`hashers.algorithm`) isn't Argon2.

#### Format

`$argon2id$v=<version>$m=<memory>,t=<iterations>,p=<parallelism>$<hash>`

#### Parameters

- `version`(`number`): The current version.
- `memory`(`number`): Amount of memory to use.
- `iterations`(`number`): Number of iterations to perform.
- `parallelism`(`number`): Degree of parallelism.
- `hash`(`string`): The computed derived key by the Argon2 algorithm encoded to Base64.

#### Example

```
$argon2id$v=19$m=32,t=2,p=4$cm94YnRVOW5jZzFzcVE4bQ$MNzk5BtR2vUhrp6qQEjRNw
```

### MD5

Ory Identities doesn't hash password by MD5 but can compare stored MD5 hashes and migrate to configured hasher
(`hashers.algorithm`). You can configure MD5 hashes to use a plain format (for hashes without salt) or a salted format (for hashes
with salt).

#### Plain format (hashes without salt)

```
$md5$<hash>
```

#### Parameters

- `hash`(`string`): The computed hash by the MD5 algorithm encoded to Base64.

#### Example

```
$md5$CY9rzUYh03PK3k6DJie09g==
```

#### Salted format (hashes with salt)

Using this format Administrators are able to import passwords that use _salting_ to calculate the MD5 hash. ORY doesn't prepend or
append _the salt_ to _User's password_ instead it offers much flexible way on how _salting_ should be done. In order to specify
that, a Base64 encoded format string should be put in the place of `salting-format` parameter. For more information about how to
configure `salting-format`, read [this section](#salting-format-parameter).

```
$md5$pf=<salting-format>$<salt>$<hash>
```

#### Parameters

- `salting-format`(`string`): Format string specifies how salting should be done. Must be encoded to Base64. For more details,
  read [this section](#salting-format-parameter).
- `salt`(`string`): A sequence of bits, known as a cryptographic salt encoded to Base64.
- `hash`(`string`): The computed hash by the MD5 algorithm encoded to Base64.

#### Example

```
$md5$pf=e1NBTFR9e1BBU1NXT1JEfQ==$MTIz$q+RdKCgc+ipCAcm5ChQwlQ==
```

##### Salting format parameter

Below are formatting specifiers that can be used in the `salting-format`.

- `{SALT}`: Salt value from the previous section.
- `{PASSWORD}`: User's password in clear text.

##### Example

Assuming that User's password is `ory123` and salt is `c2FsdDEyMw==`(_in clear text: salt123_) and the clear text form of
`salting-format` parameter as follows:

```
{SALT}--{PASSWORD}
```

In that case result of the `salting` process would be:

```
salt123--ory123
```

### PBKDF2

Ory Identities doesn't hash passwords by PBKDF2 but can compare stored PBKDF2 hash and migrate to configured hasher
(`hashers.algorithm`).

#### Format

```
$pbkdf2-<algorithm>$i=<iteration>,l=<length>$<salt>$<hash>
```

#### Parameters

- `digest`(`string`): The HMAC digest algorithm applied to derive a key of the input password.
- `iterations`(`number`): The number of iterations desired. The higher the number of iterations, the more secure the derived key
  will be, but will take a longer amount of time to complete.
- `length`(`number`): Length in octets of derived key.
- `salt`(`string`): A sequence of bits, known as a cryptographic salt encoded to Base64.
- `hash`(`string`): The computed derived key by the PBKDF2 algorithm encoded to Base64.

#### Example

```
$pbkdf2-sha256$i=100000,l=32$1jP+5Zxpxgtee/iPxGgOz0RfE9/KJuDElP1ley4VxXc$QJxzfvdbHYBpydCbHoFg3GJEqMFULwskiuqiJctoYpI
```

### SCrypt

Ory Identities doesn't hash passwords by SCrypt but can compare stored SCrypt hashes and migrate to configured hasher
(`hashers.algorithm`).

#### Format

```
$scrypt$ln=<cost>,r=<block>,p=<parrelization>$<salt>$<hash>
```

#### Parameters

- `cost`(`number`): CPU/memory cost (has to be power of 2 and >1)
- `block`(`number`): block size parameter (must satisfy r \* p < 2³⁰)
- `parallelization`(`number`): parallelization parameter (must satisfy r \* p < 2³⁰)
- `salt`(`string`): A sequence of bits, known as a cryptographic salt encoded to Base64.
- `hash`(`string`): The computed derived key by the SCrypt algorithm encoded to Base64.

#### Example

```
$scrypt$ln=16384,r=8,p=1$ZtQva9xCHzlSELH/mA7Kj5KjH2tCrkbwYzdxknkL0QQ=$pnTcXKaWVT+FwFDdk3vO1K0J7ZgOxdSU1tCJNYmn8zI=
```

### Firebase SCrypt

Ory Identities doesn't hash passwords by Firebase SCrypt but can compare stored Firebase SCrypt hashes and migrate to configured
hasher (`hashers.algorithm`).

#### Format

```
$firescrypt$ln=<mem_cost>,r=<rounds>,p=<parallelization>$<salt>$<hash>$<salt_separator>$<signer_key>
```

#### Parameters

- `mem_cost`(`number`): CPU/memory cost as given by

```
$firescrypt$ln=14,r=8,p=1$sPtDhWcd1MfdAw==$xbSou7FOl6mChCyzpCPIQ7tku7nsQMTFtyOZSXXd7tjBa4NtimOx7v42Gv2SfzPQu1oxM2/k4SsbOu73wlKe1A==$Bw==$YE0dO4bwD4JnJafh6lZZfkp1MtKzuKAXQcDCJNJNyeCHairWHKENOkbh3dzwaCdizzOspwr/FITUVlnOAwPKyw==
```

### Social sign-in connections

Similar to importing passwords it is possible to import social sign-in connections as well. If you do not have Social Sign In set
up yet please head over to the [social sign in documentation](../social-signin/overview).

When importing social sign in connections, the provider refers to the `provider` ID you set in your Social Sign In configuration.
The `subject` ID must be the ID of the user on the given platform. Usually, this is the `sub` claim of the OpenID Connect ID Token
provider such as Google.

```json {7-20}
{
  "schema_id": "preset://email",
  "traits": {
    "email": "docs-oidc@example.org"
  },
  "credentials": {
    "oidc": {
      "config": {
        "providers": [
          {
            "provider": "github",
            "subject": "12345"
          },
          {
            "provider": "google",
            "subject": "12345"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```
