# Import identities

Ory allows you to import identities from any other system. To import identities, you use the same endpoint as for
[creating identities](./20_create-users-identities.mdx). The main difference between creating and importing identities is that
when you import identities, you must provide the `credentials` field.

## Importing verified addresses

Use the `verifiable_addresses` field to import a verified address like an email address.

:::warning

You must ensure that address verification is enabled and that the `verifiable_address` is present in the identity's traits. If the
identity traits do not have the address set as the "verified address" type, the imported values will be deleted on the next
identity update.

:::

This is a sample payload for importing an identity with a verified address:

```json {4,8-11}
{
  "schema_id": "preset://email",
  "traits": {
    "email": "docs-verify@example.org"
  },
  "verifiable_addresses": [
    {
      "value": "docs-verify@example.org",
      "verified": true,
      "via": "email",
      "status": "completed"
    }
  ]
}
```

Test the above example with a cURL command:

````mdx-code-block
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs'
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem'

<Tabs
  defaultValue="cloud"
  values={[
    {label: 'The Ory Network', value: 'cloud'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="cloud">

```shell
curl --request POST -sL \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer ory_pat_xRKLsFEOUFQFVBjd6o3FQDifaLYhabGd" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{
  "schema_id": "preset://email",
  "traits": {
    "email": "docs-verify@example.org"
  },
  "verifiable_addresses": [
    {
      "value": "docs-verify@example.org",
      "verified": true,
      "via": "email",
      "status": "completed"
    }
  ]
}' https://{your-project-slug}.projects.oryapis.com/admin/identities
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
````

The API response contains the created identity:

```json {13-15}
{
  "id": "880052ae-d32c-4b56-b82d-0dc711080910",
  "schema_id": "preset://email",
  "schema_url": "https://{your-project-slug}.projects.oryapis.com/schemas/cHJlc2V0Oi8vZW1haWw",
  "state": "active",
  "state_changed_at": "2022-02-24T15:33:17.845589803Z",
  "traits": {
    "email": "docs-verify@example.org"
  },
  "verifiable_addresses": [
    {
      "id": "c3f67b59-ab58-410b-971a-06b80f38468a",
      "value": "docs-verify@example.org",
      "verified": true,
      "via": "email",
      "status": "completed",
      "created_at": "2022-02-24T15:33:17.848941Z",
      "updated_at": "2022-02-24T15:33:17.848941Z"
    }
  ],
  "recovery_addresses": [
    {
      "id": "819b53bf-79e3-452e-8a9b-0323ec9d193c",
      "value": "docs-verify@example.org",
      "via": "email",
      "created_at": "2022-02-24T15:33:17.849758Z",
      "updated_at": "2022-02-24T15:33:17.849758Z"
    }
  ],
  "created_at": "2022-02-24T15:33:17.848475Z",
  "updated_at": "2022-02-24T15:33:17.848475Z"
}
```

## Importing recovery addresses

It is possible to import a list of `recovery_addresses` - similar to `verifiable_addresses`. It is better to let the identity
schema handle setting the appropriate fields since there is no status to set for this address type.

We don't recommend setting these fields as they will be overwritten by other self-service flows. For more information on account
recovery read the [account recovery documentation](../self-service/flows/account-recovery-password-reset.mdx).

## Importing credentials

Ory supports importing credentials for identities including passwords and social sign-in connections.

### Clear text password

To import a clear text password, provide the password in the JSON payload.

:::warning

Password imports don't use any password validation. Users have to update their password according to the policy themselves using
self-service flows.

:::

```json {6-12}
{
  "schema_id": "preset://email",
  "traits": {
    "email": "docs-cleartext@example.org"
  },
  "credentials": {
    "password": {
      "config": {
        "password": "the-password"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The password `the-password` will then be hashed according to the configured password hashing algorithm and stored in the database.
The identity will be able to sign in using `docs-cleartext@example.org` and `the-password` as credentials.

### Hashed passwords

To import a hashed password, provide the hashed password in the JSON payload.

```json {6-12}
{
  "schema_id": "preset://email",
  "traits": {
    "email": "docs-hash@example.org"
  },
  "credentials": {
    "password": {
      "config": {
        "hashed_password": "$2a$10$ZsCsoVQ3xfBG/K2z2XpBf.tm90GZmtOqtqWcB5.pYd5Eq8y7RlDyq"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

<TabItem value="bcrypt" label="BCrypt">

Ory Identities can hash passwords by BCrypt and can compare stored BCrypt hash and migrate if configured hasher
(`hashers.algorithm`) isn't BCrypt.

BCrypt format is described [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt#Description).

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="argon2" label="Argon2">

Ory Identities can hash passwords by Argon2 and can compare stored Argon2 hash and migrate if configured hasher
(`hashers.algorithm`) isn't Argon2.

#### Format

`$argon2id$v=<version>$m=<memory>,t=<iterations>,p=<parallelism>$<hash>`

#### Parameters

- `version`(`number`): The current version.
- `memory`(`number`): Amount of memory to use.
- `iterations`(`number`): Number of iterations to perform.
- `parallelism`(`number`): Degree of parallelism.
- `hash`(`string`): The computed derived key by the Argon2 algorithm encoded to Base64.

#### Example

```
$argon2id$v=19$m=32,t=2,p=4$cm94YnRVOW5jZzFzcVE4bQ$MNzk5BtR2vUhrp6qQEjRNw
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="md5" label="MD5">

Ory Identities doesn't hash passwords by MD5 but can compare stored MD5 hashes and migrate to configured hasher
(`hashers.algorithm`). You can configure MD5 hashes to use a plain format (for hashes without salt) or a salted format (for hashes
with salt).

#### Plain format (hashes without salt)

```
$md5$<hash>
```

#### Parameters

- `hash`(`string`): The computed hash by the MD5 algorithm encoded to Base64.

#### Example

```
$md5$CY9rzUYh03PK3k6DJie09g==
```

#### Salted format (hashes with salt)

This format allows administrators to import passwords that use salting to calculate the MD5 hash. Ory doesn't prepend or append
the salt to the user's password. To determine the way the system performs salting, use the `salting-format` parameter.

```
$md5$pf=<salting-format>$<salt>$<hash>
```

Read [this section](#salting-format-parameter) to learn more about configuring the `salting-format` parameter.

#### Parameters

- `salting-format`(`string`): Format string specifies how salting should be done. Must be encoded to Base64.
- `salt`(`string`): A sequence of bits, known as a cryptographic salt encoded to Base64.
- `hash`(`string`): The computed hash by the MD5 algorithm encoded to Base64.

#### Example

```
$md5$pf=e1NBTFR9e1BBU1NXT1JEfQ==$MTIz$q+RdKCgc+ipCAcm5ChQwlQ==
```

##### Salting format parameter

Below are formatting specifiers that can be used in the `salting-format`.

- `{SALT}`: Salt value from the previous section.
- `{PASSWORD}`: User's password in clear text.

##### Example

Assuming that User's password is `ory123` and salt is `c2FsdDEyMw==`(_in clear text: salt123_) and the clear text form of
`salting-format` parameter as follows:

```
{SALT}--{PASSWORD}
```

In that case result of the `salting` process would be:

```
salt123--ory123
```

### Social sign-in connections

When importing social sign-in connections, the `provider` field is the social sign-in provider ID you set in your social sign-in
configuration. The `subject` ID must be the ID of the user on the given platform. Usually, this is the `sub` claim of the OpenID
Connect ID Token provider such as Google.

```json {7-20}
{
  "schema_id": "preset://email",
  "traits": {
    "email": "docs-oidc@example.org"
  },
  "credentials": {
    "oidc": {
      "config": {
        "providers": [
          {
