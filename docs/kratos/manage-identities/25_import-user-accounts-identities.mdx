# Import identities

Ory allows you to import identities from any other system. The endpoint used is the same as when
[creating identities](./create-users-identities) with the subtle difference that you also provide the `credentials` field.

## Importing verified addresses

Use the `verifiable_addresses` field to import a verified address like an email address.

:::warning

You must ensure that address verification is enabled and that the `verifiable_address` is present in the identity's traits. If the
identity traits do not have the address set as the "verified address" type, the imported values will be deleted on the next
identity update.

:::

An exemplary payload for importing an identity with a verified address:

```json {4,8-11}
{
  "schema_id": "preset://email",
  "traits": {
    "email": "docs-verify@example.org"
  },
  "verifiable_addresses": [
    {
      "value": "docs-verify@example.org",
      "verified": true,
      "via": "email",
      "status": "completed"
    }
  ]
}
```

Test the above example with a cURL command:

````mdx-code-block
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs'
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem'
import SelfHostedKratos from '@site/src/components/SelfHostedKratos'

<Tabs
  defaultValue="cloud"
  values={[
    {label: 'The Ory Network', value: 'cloud'},
    {label: 'Self-Hosted Ory Kratos', value: 'kratos'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="cloud">

```shell
curl --request POST -sL \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer ory_pat_xRKLsFEOUFQFVBjd6o3FQDifaLYhabGd" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{
  "schema_id": "preset://email",
  "traits": {
    "email": "docs-verify@example.org"
  },
  "verifiable_addresses": [
    {
      "value": "docs-verify@example.org",
      "verified": true,
      "via": "email",
      "status": "completed"
    }
  ]
}' https://playground.projects.oryapis.com/admin/identities
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="kratos">
    <SelfHostedKratos/>

And use it to create an identity:

```shell
curl --request POST -sL \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{
  "schema_id": "preset://email",
  "traits": {
    "email": "docs-verify@example.org"
  },
  "verifiable_addresses": [
    {
      "value": "docs-verify@example.org",
      "verified": true,
      "via": "email",
      "status": "completed"
    }
  ]
}' http://127.0.0.1:4434/identities
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
````

The API then responds with the created identity:

```json {13-15}
{
  "id": "880052ae-d32c-4b56-b82d-0dc711080910",
  "schema_id": "preset://email",
  "schema_url": "http://localhost:4455/schemas/cHJlc2V0Oi8vZW1haWw",
  "state": "active",
  "state_changed_at": "2022-02-24T15:33:17.845589803Z",
  "traits": {
    "email": "docs-verify@example.org"
  },
  "verifiable_addresses": [
    {
      "id": "c3f67b59-ab58-410b-971a-06b80f38468a",
      "value": "docs-verify@example.org",
      "verified": true,
      "via": "email",
      "status": "completed",
      "created_at": "2022-02-24T15:33:17.848941Z",
      "updated_at": "2022-02-24T15:33:17.848941Z"
    }
  ],
  "recovery_addresses": [
    {
      "id": "819b53bf-79e3-452e-8a9b-0323ec9d193c",
      "value": "docs-verify@example.org",
      "via": "email",
      "created_at": "2022-02-24T15:33:17.849758Z",
      "updated_at": "2022-02-24T15:33:17.849758Z"
    }
  ],
  "created_at": "2022-02-24T15:33:17.848475Z",
  "updated_at": "2022-02-24T15:33:17.848475Z"
}
```

## Importing recovery addresses

It is possible to import a list of `recovery_addresses` - similar to `verifiable_addresses`. It is better to let the identity
schema handle setting the appropriate fields since there is no status to set for this address type.

We do not recommend setting these fields as they will be overwritten by other self-service flows! For more information on account
recovery please head over to the [account recovery documentation](../self-service/flows/account-recovery-password-reset.mdx).

## Importing credentials

Ory supports importing credentials for identities including passwords and social sign in. You can use all of these payloads with
the `curl` command from above!

### Clear text password

To import a clear text password, provide the password in the JSON payload.

:::warning

Password imports do not use any password validation. Users have to update their password according to the policy themselves using
self-service flows.

:::

```json {6-12}
{
  "schema_id": "preset://email",
  "traits": {
    "email": "docs-cleartext@example.org"
  },
  "credentials": {
    "password": {
      "config": {
        "password": "the-password"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The password `the-password` will then be hashed according to the configured password hashing algorithm and stored in the database.
The identity will be able to sign in using `docs-cleartext@example.org` and `the-password` as credentials.

### Hashed passwords

To import a hashed password, provide the hashed password in the JSON payload.

```json {6-12}
{
  "schema_id": "preset://email",
  "traits": {
    "email": "docs-hash@example.org"
  },
  "credentials": {
    "password": {
      "config": {
        "hashed_password": "$2a$10$ZsCsoVQ3xfBG/K2z2XpBf.tm90GZmtOqtqWcB5.pYd5Eq8y7RlDyq"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### BCrypt

Ory Identities can hash passwords by BCrypt and can compare stored BCrypt hash and migrate if configured hasher
(`hashers.algorithm`) isn't BCrypt.

#### Format

BCrypt format is described [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt#Description).

### Argon2

Ory Identities can hash passwords by Argon2 and can compare stored Argon2 hash and migrate if configured hasher
(`hashers.algorithm`) isn't Argon2.

#### Format

#### Parameters

- `version`(`number`): The current version.
- `memory`(`number`): Amount of memory to use.
- `iterations`(`number`): Number of iterations to perform.
- `parallelism`(`number`): Degree of parallelism.
- `hash`(`string`): The computed derived key by the Argon2 algorithm encoded in base64.

```

#### Parameters

- `digest`(`string`): The HMAC digest algorithm applied to derive a key of the input password.
- `iterations`(`number`): The number of iterations desired. The higher the number of iterations, the more secure the derived key

```

### Social sign-in connections

Similar to importing passwords it is possible to import social sign-in connections as well. If you do not have Social Sign In set
up yet please head over to the [social sign in documentation](../social-signin/overview).

When importing social sign in connections, the provider refers to the `provider` ID you set in your Social Sign In configuration.
The `subject` ID must be the ID of the user on the given platform. Usually, this is the `sub` claim of the OpenID Connect ID Token
provider such as Google.

```json {7-20}
{
  "schema_id": "preset://email",
  "traits": {
    "email": "docs-oidc@example.org"
  },
  "credentials": {
    "oidc": {
      "config": {
        "providers": [
          {
            "provider": "github",
            "subject": "12345"
          },
          {
            "provider": "google",
            "subject": "12345"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```
