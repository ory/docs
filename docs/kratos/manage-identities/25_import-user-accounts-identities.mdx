# Import identities

Ory allows you to import identities from any other system. To import identities, you use the same endpoint as for
[creating identities](./20_create-users-identities.mdx). The main difference between creating and importing identities is that
when you import identities, you must provide the `credentials` field.

## Importing verified addresses

Use the `verifiable_addresses` field to import a verified address like an email address.

:::danger

You must ensure that address verification is enabled and that the `verifiable_address` is present in the identity's traits. If the
identity traits do not have the address set as the "verified address" type, the imported values will be deleted on the next
identity update.

:::

This is a sample payload for importing an identity with a verified address:

```json {4,8-11}
{
  "schema_id": "preset://email",
  "traits": {
    "email": "docs-verify@example.org"
  },
  "verifiable_addresses": [
    {
      "value": "docs-verify@example.org",
      "verified": true,
      "via": "email",
      "status": "completed"
    }
  ]
}
```

Test the above example with a cURL command:

````mdx-code-block
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs'
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem'

<Tabs
  defaultValue="cloud"
  values={[
    {label: 'Ory Network', value: 'cloud'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="cloud">

```shell
curl --request POST -sL \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer ory_pat_xRKLsFEOUFQFVBjd6o3FQDifaLYhabGd" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{
  "schema_id": "preset://email",
  "traits": {
    "email": "docs-verify@example.org"
  },
  "verifiable_addresses": [
    {
      "value": "docs-verify@example.org",
      "verified": true,
      "via": "email",
      "status": "completed"
    }
  ]
}' https://$PROJECT_SLUG.projects.oryapis.com/admin/identities
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
````

The API response contains the created identity:

```json {13-15}
{
  "id": "880052ae-d32c-4b56-b82d-0dc711080910",

    }
  ],
  "recovery_addresses": [
    {
      "id": "819b53bf-79e3-452e-8a9b-0323ec9d193c",
      "value": "docs-verify@example.org",
      "via": "email",
      "created_at": "2022-02-24T15:33:17.849758Z",
      "updated_at": "2022-02-24T15:33:17.849758Z"
    }
  ],
  "created_at": "2022-02-24T15:33:17.848475Z",
  "updated_at": "2022-02-24T15:33:17.848475Z"
}
```

## Importing recovery addresses

It is possible to import a list of `recovery_addresses` - similar to `verifiable_addresses`. It is better to let the identity
schema handle setting the appropriate fields since there is no status to set for this address type.

We don't recommend setting these fields as they will be overwritten by other self-service flows. For more information on account
recovery read the [account recovery documentation](../self-service/flows/account-recovery-password-reset.mdx).

## Importing credentials

Ory supports importing credentials for identities including passwords and social sign-in connections.

### Clear text password

To import a clear text password, provide the password in the JSON payload.

:::danger

Password imports don't use any password validation. Users have to update their password according to the policy themselves using
self-service flows.

:::

```json {6-12}
{
  "schema_id": "preset://email",
  "traits": {
    "email": "docs-cleartext@example.org"
  },
  "credentials": {
    "password": {
      "config": {
        "password": "the-password"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The password `the-password` will then be hashed according to the configured password hashing algorithm and stored in the database.
The identity will be able to sign in using `docs-cleartext@example.org` and `the-password` as credentials.

When importing clear text passwords, the process may be slower than expected because each password must be hashed during the
import process. If you are batch importing more than 20 clear text passwords, please hash the passwords before importing them to
avoid timeouts.

### Hashed passwords

To import a hashed password, provide the hashed password in the JSON payload.

```json {6-12}
{
  "schema_id": "preset://email",
  "traits": {
    "email": "docs-hash@example.org"
  },
  "credentials": {
    "password": {
      "config": {
        "hashed_password": "$2a$10$ZsCsoVQ3xfBG/K2z2XpBf.tm90GZmtOqtqWcB5.pYd5Eq8y7RlDyq"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The value of the hashed password is different depending on the algorithm used. The following algorithms are supported:

````mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="bcrypt" label="BCrypt">

Ory Identities can hash passwords by BCrypt and can compare stored BCrypt hash and migrate if configured hasher
(`hashers.algorithm`) isn't BCrypt.

BCrypt format is described [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt#Description).

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="argon2" label="Argon2">

Ory Identities can hash passwords by Argon2 and can compare stored Argon2 hash and migrate if configured hasher
(`hashers.algorithm`) isn't Argon2.

#### Format

`$argon2id$v=<version>$m=<memory>,t=<iterations>,p=<parallelism>$<hash>`

#### Parameters

- `version`(`number`): The current version.
- `memory`(`number`): Amount of memory to use.

- `hash`(`string`): The computed derived key by the Argon2 algorithm encoded to Base64.

#### Example

```
$argon2id$v=19$m=32,t=2,p=4$cm94YnRVOW5jZzFzcVE4bQ$MNzk5BtR2vUhrp6qQEjRNw
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="md5" label="MD5">

Ory Identities doesn't hash passwords by MD5 but can compare stored MD5 hashes and migrate to configured hasher
(`hashers.algorithm`). You can configure MD5 hashes to use a plain format (for hashes without salt) or a salted format (for hashes
with salt).

#### Plain format (hashes without salt)

```
$md5$<hash>
```

#### Parameters

- `hash`(`string`): The computed hash by the MD5 algorithm encoded to Base64.

#### Example

```
$md5$CY9rzUYh03PK3k6DJie09g==
```

#### Salted format (hashes with salt)

This format allows administrators to import passwords that use salting to calculate the MD5 hash. Ory doesn't prepend or append
the salt to the user's password. To determine the way the system performs salting, use the `salting-format` parameter.

```
$md5$pf=<salting-format>$<salt>$<hash>
```

Read [this section](#salting-format-parameter) to learn more about configuring the `salting-format` parameter.

#### Parameters

- `salting-format`(`string`): Format string specifies how salting should be done. Must be encoded to Base64.
- `salt`(`string`): A sequence of bits, known as a cryptographic salt encoded to Base64.
- `hash`(`string`): The computed hash by the MD5 algorithm encoded to Base64.

#### Example

```
$md5$pf=e1NBTFR9e1BBU1NXT1JEfQ==$MTIz$q+RdKCgc+ipCAcm5ChQwlQ==
```

##### Salting format parameter

Below are formatting specifiers that can be used in the `salting-format`.

- `{SALT}`: Salt value from the previous section.
- `{PASSWORD}`: User's password in clear text.

##### Example

Assuming that User's password is `ory123` and salt is `c2FsdDEyMw==`(_in clear text: salt123_) and the clear text form of
`salting-format` parameter as follows:

```
{SALT}--{PASSWORD}
```

In that case result of the `salting` process would be:

```
salt123--ory123
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="sha" label="SHA">

Ory Identities doesn't hash passwords by SHA but can compare stored SHA hashes and migrate to configured hasher

### Password migration using a web hook

If you want to import users, but do not have access to the hashed password, or the hashed password is in a format that Ory
Identities does not support, you can use a web hook to migrate the password.

The web hook will be called when the user logs in, and will receive the user's identifier and password. If the web hook returns
successfully, the user will be logged in and the hashed password will be stored.

The following steps are necessary to set up password migration using a web hook:

1.  Import an identity with an empty password hash and `use_password_migration_hook` set to `true`

    [Bulk-import](#bulk-import-identities-from-other-providers) all your users with an empty password hash and
    `use_password_migration_hook` set:

    ```json {9-10}
    {
      "schema_id": "preset://email",
      "traits": {
        "email": "pw-migration@example.org"
      },
      "credentials": {
        "password": {
          "config": {
            "hashed_password": "",
            "use_password_migration_hook": true
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

2.  Configure a password migration web hook

    Add the web hook URL to the configuration. See the
    [web hook configuration](../../guides/integrate-with-ory-cloud-through-webhooks.mdx#request-authentication) for authentication
    options. If you use Ory Network, update this configuration directly using the
    [Ory CLI](https://www.ory.com/docs/guides/cli/identity-cli).

    ```yaml
    selfservice:
      methods:
        password:
          config:
            migrate_hook:
              enabled: true
              config:
                url: https://example.org/migrate-password
                body: base64://ENCODED_JSONNET # see the general webhook documentation for more information
                auth:
                  type: api_key
                  config:
                    name: Authorization
                    value: { API Key value }
                    in: header # alternatively "cookie"
    ```

    The `body` configuration field is a JSONNet snippet that will be used to map the request body to the web hook. The available
    context is the
    [same as for other webhooks](../../guides/integrate-with-ory-cloud-through-webhooks.mdx#customizing-request-body-with-jsonnet),
    plus these fields:

    ```json5
    {
      identifier: "user@example.com",
      password: "123456",
      // also available: "identity", "flow", "request_url", "request_headers", "request_cookies", "request_method"
    }
    ```

3.  Implement the password migration web hook

    If a user logs in and the identifier points to an identity that has `use_password_migration_hook` set to `true`, Ory
    Identities will call the configured web hook URL. The body of the request will be mapped using the provided JSONNet snippet,
    or default to this payload when no `body` snippet is configured:

    ```json
    {
      "identifier": "pw-migration@example.org",
      "password": "the-password"
    }
    ```

    The web hook can then check the identifier and password against the legacy system. If the password matches, the web hook must
    respond with a `200 OK` status code and the following payload:

    ```json
    {
      "status": "password_match"
    }
    ```

    After a successful response, the identity will be updated with the hashed password and the user will be logged in. The
    password migration hook will not be called again for this identity.

    If the password does not match, the webhook should return `403 Forbidden`, to indicate to the user that the password did not
    match.

    Any other response will be treated as an unexpected error, and the user will not be logged in.

### Social sign-in connections

When importing social sign-in connections, the `provider` field is the social sign-in provider ID you set in your social sign-in
configuration. The `subject` ID must be the ID of the user on the given platform. Usually, this is the `sub` claim of the OpenID
Connect ID Token provider such as Google.

```json {7-20}
{
  "schema_id": "preset://email",
  "traits": {
    "email": "docs-oidc@example.org"
  },
  "credentials": {
    "oidc": {
      "config": {
        "providers": [
          {
            "provider": "github",
            "subject": "12345"
          },
          {
            "provider": "google",
            "subject": "12345"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Importing social sign-in connections with email

If the previous system didn't record the immutable user/subject ID but only the connection's email address, Ory provides a way to
automatically link the email address with the social sign-in provider. However, the email address must be available for this
process.

For more details, refer to the
[automatic account linking documentation](../social-signin/95_account-linking.mdx#automatic-account-linking).

### SAML connections

When importing SAML connections, the `provider` field is the SAML provider ID you set in your SAML configuration. The `subject` ID
must be the ID of the user on the given platform. The subject should not be an email, but a fixed user ID that never changes.

```json {7-20}
{
  "schema_id": "preset://email",
  "traits": {
    "email": "docs-oidc@example.org"
  },
  "credentials": {
    "saml": {
      "config": {
        "providers": [
          {
            "provider": "okta",
            "subject": "12345"
          },
          {
            "provider": "one-login",
            "subject": "12345"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Organization-specific SAML and OIDC connections

When importing SAML or OIDC connections that are only available for certain [organizations](../organizations/organizations.mdx)
(for example `email@companyname.com`), you can use the `organization` field to specify the organization that the user belongs to.

```json
{
  "schema_id": "preset://email",
  "traits": {
    "email": "docs-oidc@example.org"

## Bulk import identities from other providers

To import multiple identities into Ory Identities, use the
[Identity Import API](../reference/api#tag/identity/operation/batchPatchIdentities).

#### Limits

The Identity Import API enforces limits which are documented in the
[API reference](../reference/api#tag/identity/operation/batchPatchIdentities).

- Avoid importing large batches with plaintext passwords, as they can cause timeouts.
- If you need to import more identities, split the import into multiple requests.

#### Request format

The endpoint accepts a JSON array of identities, each of which must have a `create` property that holds the identity that should
be created. Optionally, you can specify a `patch_id` property which must be a UUID to be returned in the response. This can be
used to correlate the response with the patch.

The following example shows how to import two identities. It will create two identities with the email addresses `foo@example.com`
and `bar@example.com` and the passwords `foopassword` and `barpassword` respectively.

```bash
curl --location --request PATCH 'https://${YOUR_PROJECT_SLUG}.projects.oryapis.com/admin/identities' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer ${YOUR_ORY_ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "identities": [
        {
# highlight-next-line
            "patch_id": "6086b0a8-d851-5431-91b4-b6e5e39dc88b",
            "create": {
                "credentials": {
                    "password": {
                        "config": {
                            "password": "foopassword"
                        }
                    }
                },
                "state": "active",
                "traits": {
                    "email": "foo@example.com"
                },
                "schema_id": "preset://email"
            }
        },
        {
# highlight-next-line
            "patch_id": "d554dc00-49ce-5381-9bdc-79637dec85a2",
            "create": {
                "credentials": {
                    "password": {
                        "config": {
                            "password": "barpassword"
                        }
                    }
                },
                "state": "active",
                "traits": {
                    "email": "bar@example.com"
                },
                "schema_id": "preset://email"
            }
        }
    ]
}'
```

#### Successful response

If at least one identity is successfully imported, the API responds with HTTP 200 OK. The response contains an array of results
per identity. Each entry includes the corresponding patch_id to correlate the response with the request.

```json
{
  "identities": [
    {
      "action": "create",
      // highlight-next-line
      "patch_id": "6086b0a8-d851-5431-91b4-b6e5e39dc88b",
      "identity": "55f93ea4-09ff-4273-8b88-082cc70d6d44"
    },
    {
      "action": "create",
      // highlight-next-line
      "patch_id": "d554dc00-49ce-5381-9bdc-79637dec85a2",
      "identity": "f70c9b29-4790-4330-90dc-920db16a4b85"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Errors during bulk import

Failure to import an identity will not do not affect the entire bulk import. In the response, `"action": "error"` indicates that
the identity with the corresponding `patch_id` could not be imported. The `patch_id` can be set on each identity passed to
`PATCH /admin/identities`. The `error` object contains more details about why the import failed.

Example with both successful and failed imports:

```json
{
  "identities": [
    {
      "action": "create",
      "identity": "0d0ed560-43ce-42a9-bd40-aafe921c3af1",
      "patch_id": "6086b0a8-d851-5431-91b4-b6e5e39dc88b"
    },
    {
      // highlight-start
      "action": "error",
      "patch_id": "d554dc00-49ce-5381-9bdc-79637dec85a2",
      "error": {
        "code": 400,
        "status": "Bad Request",
        "reason": "The request was malformed or contained invalid parameters",
        "message": "The request was malformed or contained invalid parameters"
      }
      // highlight-end
    },
    {
      // highlight-start
      "action": "error",
      "patch_id": "1634f1e9-8419-5a54-8191-2260c8aaea31",
      "error": {
        "code": 409,
        "status": "Conflict",
        "reason": "This identity conflicts with another identity that already exists.",
        "message": "The resource could not be created due to a conflict"
      }
      // highlight-end
    },
    {
      "action": "create",
      "identity": "b8651770-be8d-460b-b86f-679c4ba50264",
      "patch_id": "eade6651-9311-5624-8afd-e4a3e05e0c4a"
    }
  ]
}
```

If no identity is imported, the response will return one of the following errors:

- `400 Bad Request` – The request payload is invalid or improperly formatted.
- `409 Conflict` – Duplicate identities or conflicting data detected.

#### Troubleshooting 504 Gateway Timeout

- Reduce the batch size
- Avoid duplicate identities
- Pre-hash passwords using BCrypt
