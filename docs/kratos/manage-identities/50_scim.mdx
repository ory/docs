# System for Cross-domain Identity Management

```

SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management) is a standard for automating the exchange of user identity information between
identity domains or IT systems. It is designed to simplify the management of user identities in cloud-based applications and
services. SCIM provides a common schema for representing user identities and a RESTful API for managing them. This allows
organizations to automate the provisioning and de-provisioning of user accounts across multiple systems, reducing administrative
burden and improving security.

In Ory Network, SCIM is available at the organization level. This means that within one project, you can have multiple
organizations with different SCIM configurations. Each organization can have its own SCIM settings, including the ability to
enable or disable SCIM, set the base URL for SCIM endpoints, and configure authentication methods. This allows organizations to
tailor their SCIM implementation to meet their specific needs and requirements.

Identities provisioned through the SCIM API are automatically created in Ory Network and added to that SCIM server's organization.
The provisioned identities can then log in through any of the organization's configured SSO methods.

## Set up identity provisioning with SCIM

To set up identity provisioning with SCIM, follow these steps:

### Create an organization

If you haven't already, create an [organization](../organizations). This organization will be used to manage your SCIM settings
and provision identities.

### Configure a SCIM client

In the organization view, under **SCIM clients**, click **Add SCIM client**. This will open a form where you can configure your
SCIM client's settings.

- **Client ID**: Enter an identifier for your SCIM client. This identifier will be part of the URL the client uses to access the
  Ory Network SCIM server. It should be unique within your project.
- **Label**: Enter a human-readable label for your SCIM client.
- **Authorization header secret**: Enter a secret in the client authentication's **secret** field. This secret will be used to
  authenticate requests to the SCIM server. Clients need to specify this in the `Authorization` header of their requests.
- **Data mapping**: When the client creates or updates a user, the supplied data will be applied to the identity based on this
  data mapping. See below for more details.

### Data mapping

The data mapping is a Jsonnet script that defines how the data the SCIM client sends should be mapped to the identity in the Ory
Network. This mapping will be applied any time the SCIM client creates or updates a user (`POST`, `PATCH`, or `PUT`), and the
identity will be updated accordingly. However, the mapping is unidirectional. For example, if the user updates an identity trait
that was previously set by the SCIM client, the SCIM client will not be able to retrieve the updated value.

In the context of the Jsonnet script, the SCIM user data is available as `std.extVar('scim')`. For the available attributes, refer
to the [SCIM user resource schema](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7643#section-4.1) or the documentation below.

The script should return a JSON object as defined in the [Jsonnet reference](../reference/jsonnet#output).

### Use the SCIM client

Once you have configured a SCIM client, you can use it to provision identities. The Ory Network SCIM server provides a set of
endpoints that allow the creation and management of user identities and groups.

Please refer to these guides for setting up SCIM with specific identity providers:

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

<DocCardList />
```

For generic SCIM clients, the following endpoints are available:

- **User endpoints**
  - `GET /Users`: Retrieve a list of users.
  - `POST /Users`: Create a new user.
  - `GET /Users/{id}`: Retrieve a specific user by ID.
  - `PUT /Users/{id}`: Update a specific user by ID.
  - `PATCH /Users/{id}`: Partially update a specific user by ID.
  - `DELETE /Users/{id}`: Delete a specific user by ID.
- **Group endpoints**
  - `GET /Groups`: Retrieve a list of groups.
  - `POST /Groups`: Create a new group.
  - `GET /Groups/{id}`: Retrieve a specific group by ID.
  - `PUT /Groups/{id}`: Update a specific group by ID.
  - `PATCH /Groups/{id}`: Partially update a specific group by ID.
  - `DELETE /Groups/{id}`: Delete a specific group by ID.

### SCIM resource schemas

For programmatic discovery of the SCIM resource schemas, you can use the `GET /Schemas` endpoint. This will return a list of all
available schemas.

### SCIM user resource schema

Ory Network fully supports the standard SCIM user resource schema as defined in the
[SCIM RFC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7643#section-4.1). In detail, the following attributes are supported:

### SCIM group resource schema

Ory Network fully supports the standard SCIM group resource schema as defined in the
[SCIM RFC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7643#section-4.2). In detail, the following attributes are supported:

| Name          | Type   | Remarks                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`          | UUID   | Read-only, this is the group ID.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `externalId`  | string | Optional, an ID set by the SCIM client. If set, this ID must be unique in the context of the organization.                                                                                                      |
| `displayName` | string | Required, the name of the group.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `members`     | array  | List of members. Each member can have a `value` (string), `display` (string), and `type` (string). `value` is either an identity ID (when `type` equals `"User"`) or a group ID (when `type` equals `"Group"`). |

### Group memberships

The SCIM server supports group memberships. To update group memberships, use the `members` property on the `Groups` resource.
Groups also support nested sub-groups. However, in the user resource, only the direct group memberships are included.

## Events

Ory Network emits events for all SCIM operations that modify data. These events allow you to track and respond to changes in your
identity ecosystem.

| SCIM Action           | Events Emitted                 | Description                                                              |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `POST /Users`         | IdentityCreated                | Emitted when a new identity is provisioned                               |
| `PUT /Users/{id}`     | IdentityUpdated                | Emitted when an identity is updated                                      |
| `PATCH /Users/{id}`   | IdentityUpdated                | Emitted when an identity is partially updated                            |
| `DELETE /Users/{id}`  | IdentityDeleted                | Emitted when an identity is deleted                                      |
| `POST /Groups`        | GroupCreated                   | Emitted when a new group is created                                      |
| `PUT /Groups/{id}`    | GroupUpdated + IdentityUpdated | Emitted when a group is updated, for the group and all members           |
| `PATCH /Groups/{id}`  | GroupUpdated + IdentityUpdated | Emitted when a group is partially updated, for the group and all members |
| `DELETE /Groups/{id}` | GroupDeleted + IdentityUpdated | Emitted when a group is deleted, for the group and all members           |

### Event attributes

| Event Type                       | Attribute        | Description                                                      |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| All events                       | `ScimClient`     | Contains the ID of the SCIM client that made the request         |
| IdentityCreated, IdentityUpdated | `IdentityActive` | Boolean indicating if the identity is active (`true` or `false`) |

These events provide visibility into all SCIM-related changes and can be used for auditing, automation, or integration with other
systems in your organization.

## Known limitations

- When querying users with `GET /Users`, the SCIM server only supports the `eq` operator for filtering, and only with the
  `userName` attribute. Other operators like `ne`, `co`, `sw`, and `ew` are not supported.
- When querying groups with `GET /Groups`, the SCIM server only supports the `eq` operator for filtering, and only with the
  `displayName` attribute. Other operators like `ne`, `co`, `sw`, and `ew` are not supported.
- For both user and group query endpoints, `startIndex` must be lower than 5000, and `count` must be lower than 1000.
- If the user already exists within the project or organization, the provisioning may fail with a 409 conflict error. This is
  because the SCIM server cannot modify existing users that have not been provisioned via SCIM. In this case, you need to manually
  delete the user first.
