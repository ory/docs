# System for Cross-domain Identity Management

:::info

SCIM provisioning is only available in Ory Network and via the Ory Enterprise License (OEL). If you have any questions, please
[reach out](https://www.ory.sh/contact/).

:::

SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management) is a standard for automating the exchange of user identity information between
identity domains or IT systems. It is designed to make it easier to manage user identities in cloud-based applications and
services. SCIM provides a common schema for representing user identities and a RESTful API for managing them. This allows
organizations to automate the provisioning and de-provisioning of user accounts across multiple systems, reducing the
administrative burden and improving security.

In the Ory Network, SCIM is available at the organization level. This means that within one project, you can have multiple
organizations with different SCIM configurations. Each organization can have its own SCIM settings, including the ability to
enable or disable SCIM, set the base URL for SCIM endpoints, and configure authentication methods. This allows organizations to
tailor their SCIM implementation to meet their specific needs and requirements.

Identities that are provisioned through the SCIM API are automatically created in the Ory Network and added to that SCIM server's
organization. The provisioned identities can then log in through any of the organization's configured SSO methods.

## Set up identity provisioning with SCIM

To set up identity provisioning with SCIM, follow these steps:

### Create an organization

If you haven't already, create an [organization](../organizations). This organization will be used to manage your SCIM settings
and provision identities.

### Configure a SCIM client

In the organization view, under **SCIM clients**, click **Add SCIM client**. This will open a form where you can configure your
SCIM client's settings.

- **Client ID**: Enter an identifier for your SCIM client. This identifier will be part of the URL the client uses to access the
  Ory Network SCIM server. It should be unique within your project.
- **Label**: Enter a human-readable label for your SCIM client. the SCIM server.
- **Authorization header secret**: Enter a secret in the client authenticaiton's **secret** field. This secret will be used to
  authenticate requests to the SCIM server. Clients need to specify this in the `Authorization` header of their requests.
- **Data mapping**: When the client creates or updates a user, the supplied data will be applied to the identity based on this
  data mapping.

### Use the SCIM client

Once you have configured a SCIM client, you can use it to provision identities. The Ory Network SCIM server provides a set of
endpoints that allow the creation and management of user identities and groups.

The following endpoints are available:

- **User endpoints**
  - `GET /Users`: Retrieve a list of users.
  - `POST /Users`: Create a new user.
  - `GET /Users/{id}`: Retrieve a specific user by ID.
  - `PUT /Users/{id}`: Update a specific user by ID.
  - `PATCH /Users/{id}`: Partially update a specific user by ID.
  - `DELETE /Users/{id}`: Delete a specific user by ID.
- **Group endpoints**
  - `GET /Groups`: Retrieve a list of groups.
  - `POST /Groups`: Create a new group.
  - `GET /Groups/{id}`: Retrieve a specific group by ID.
  - `PUT /Groups/{id}`: Update a specific group by ID.
  - `PATCH /Groups/{id}`: Partially update a specific group by ID.
  - `DELETE /Groups/{id}`: Delete a specific group by ID.

### Known limitations

- For querying users with `GET /Users`, the SCIM server only supports the `eq` operator for filtering, and only with the
  `userName` attribute. Other operators like `ne`, `co`, `sw`, and `ew` are not supported.
- For querying groups with `GET /Groups`, the SCIM server only supports the `eq` operator for filtering, and only with the
  `displayName` attribute. Other operators like `ne`, `co`, `sw`, and `ew` are not supported.
- For both user and group query endpoints, `startIndex` must be lower than 5000, and `count` must be lower than 1000.
- If the user already exists within the project or organization the provisioning may fail with a 409 conflict error. This is
  because the SCIM server cannot modify existing users that have not been provisioned via SCIM. In this case, you need to manually
  delete the user first.
