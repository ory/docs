## Troubleshooting

When the provisioning fails, both in Ory Network and Okta you will see an error message. In Ory Network, navigate to
**Activity** > **Logs & Events** and look for `SCIM provisioning error` events.

In Okta, navigate to the **Assignments** tab and click on the red exclamation mark next to the user. This will show you the error
response from Ory Network.
