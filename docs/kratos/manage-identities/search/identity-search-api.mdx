Advanced identity search allows you to perform full-text search on identity traits, public and admin metadata, combined with
arbitrary filters and faceting.

## Getting started

We recommend using the [Typesense SDKs](https://typesense.org/docs/29.0/api/api-clients.html) for your preferred language to
interact with the advanced identity search API. Pass your [Ory Network API key](/concepts/personal-access-token) where you would
normally pass the Typesense API key, use the following base URL:

```shell
https://{your-ory-slug}.projects.oryapis.com/admin/preview/search/v0beta1
```

and set the collection name to `identities-{your-project-id}`.

See the following examples for how to configure and use the Typesense SDKs to search for identities.

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="shell" label="cURL" default>
    <CodeBlock language="shell">{basic}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="go" label="Go">
    <CodeBlock language="go">{goExample}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="java" label="Java">
    <CodeBlock language="clike">{javaExample}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

## Data model

The collection `identities-{your-project-id}` contains one document per identity. Each document contains the following fields:

```mdx-code-block
<CodeBlock language="json5">{model}</CodeBlock>
```

:::tip

To avoid timing out search requests, specify the exact fields you want to search in using the `query_by` parameter. For example,
to search for identities by email, use `query_by=traits.email`.

:::

:::note

Because of technical limitations, non-string data in `metadata_admin` and `metadata_public` will be indexed as strings and
returned from the Search API as strings.

To retrieve the original JSON data, fetch the full identity using the
[Get Identity API](/reference/api#tag/identity/operation/getIdentity).

:::

## Advanced search example

Please refer to the [Typesense documentation](https://typesense.org/docs/29.0/api/search.html) for details on how to construct
arbitrary search queries. An example:

```mdx-code-block

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="curl" label="cURL" default>
    <CodeBlock language="shell">{advanced}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="result" label="sample result">
    <CodeBlock language="json5">{advancedResult}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

:::tip

Most fields support infix-searching as well, so queries like `query_by=@example.com&infix=always&query_by=traits.email` are
possible.

## Consistency and availability

The search index powering advanced identity search is eventually consistent with the main identity store. This means that there
will be a delay between creating, updating, or deleting an identity and the changes being reflected in search results. We try to
aim for a delay of less than one second during normal operation, but cannot provide any guarantees. The search index will have to
be rebuilt periodically, during which time we cannot service search requests.

We recommend you use the search API for non-time-critical use cases, such as admin UIs or background jobs, where you need to full
capability of full-text search, filtering, faceting, and sorting.

Before displaying search results to end-users or otherwise using the search results for business logic, we recommend you always
[fetch the full identity](/reference/api#tag/identity/operation/getIdentity) from the main identity store using the identity ID
returned in search results to ensure you have the most up-to-date information.
