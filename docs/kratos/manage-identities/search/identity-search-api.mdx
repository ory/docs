Advanced identity search allows you to perform full-text search on identity traits, public and admin metadata, combined with
arbitrary filters and faceting.

## Getting started

We recommend using the [Typesense library](https://typesense.org/docs/29.0/api/api-clients.html) for your preferred language to
interact with the advanced identity search API. Pass your [Ory Network API key](/concepts/personal-access-token) where you would
normally pass the Typesense API key, use the following base URL:

```shell
https://{your-ory-slug}.projects.oryapis.com/admin/preview/search/v0beta1
```

Set the collection name to `identities-{your-project-id}`.

See the following examples for how to configure and use the Typesense library to search for identities.

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="shell" label="cURL" default>
    <CodeBlock language="shell">{basic}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="go" label="Go">
    <CodeBlock language="go">{goExample}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="java" label="Java">
    <CodeBlock language="clike">{javaExample}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

## Data model

The `identities-{your-project-id}` collection contains one document per identity. Each document contains the following fields:

```mdx-code-block
<CodeBlock language="json5">{model}</CodeBlock>
```

:::tip

To avoid search requests timing out, specify the exact fields you want to search by using the `query_by` parameter. For example,
to search for identities by email, use `query_by=traits.email`.

:::

:::note

Because of technical limitations, non-string data in `metadata_admin` and `metadata_public` will be indexed as strings and
returned from the Search API as strings.

To retrieve the original JSON data, fetch the full identity using the
[Get Identity API](/reference/api#tag/identity/operation/getIdentity).

:::

## Advanced search example

Please refer to the [Typesense documentation](https://typesense.org/docs/29.0/api/search.html) for details on how to construct
custom search queries. An example:

```mdx-code-block

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="curl" label="cURL" default>
    <CodeBlock language="shell">{advanced}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="result" label="sample result">
    <CodeBlock language="json5">{advancedResult}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

:::tip

Most fields support infix-searching as well, so queries like `query_by=@example.com&infix=always&query_by=traits.email` are
possible.

## Consistency and availability

When you create, update, or delete an identity, there is a slight delay in the change being reflected in the advanced 
identity search results. Any changes should take less that one second for the search index to become consistent with the 
main identity store, during normal operations. The search index will have to be rebuilt periodically, during which time you 
cannot perform advanced search requests.

We recommend you use the search API only for non-time-critical use cases, such as admin UIs or background jobs, where you need to full
capability of full-text search, filtering, faceting, and sorting.

Before displaying search results to end-users or otherwise using the search results for business logic, we recommend you always
[fetch the full identity](/reference/api#tag/identity/operation/getIdentity) from the main identity store using the identity ID
returned in search results to ensure you have the most up-to-date information.
