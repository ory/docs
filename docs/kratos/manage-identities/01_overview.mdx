# Identity model

Identities are sets of data that describe humans that sign up on a website or an application, for example online store customers,
file sharing service users, or company contractors signing up to use internal systems.

:::info

What Ory calls identities, other software often refers to as "users", "accounts", or "user accounts". For the sake of clarity, we
use the term "identity" interchangeably with other common names for user accounts in the documentation.

:::

Identities are created on the basis of schemas, which define what fields (data) the system stores for the identity. Thanks to
schemas, every identity created in your system can store its own set of data, which allows you to easily differentiate between
user types, for example customers and employees.

## Identity example

This is a sample identity presented in the YAML format. To manage identities, use the `/admin/identities` endpoint. Keep in mind
that the API payload is in JSON format.

```yaml
# This is a UUID generated when the identity is created. Can't be changed or updated.
id: "9f425a8d-7efc-4768-8f23-7647a74fdf13"

# Every identity has a state. Inactive identities can't log into the system.
state: active

# This section represents all credentials associated with the identity.
credentials:
  password:
    id: password
    identifiers:
      - john.doe@acme.com
      - johnd@ory.com
    config:
      hashed_password: ...
  oidc:
    id: oidc
    identifiers:
      - google:j8kf7a3...
      - facebook:83475891...
    config:
      - provider: google
        identifier: j8kf7a3
      - provider: facebook
        identifier: 83475891

# This is the JSON Schema ID used for validating the traits of this identity.
schema_id: default

# Traits represent information about the identity, such as the first or last name. The traits content is
# up to you and will be validated using the JSON Schema at `traits_schema_url`.
traits:
  # These are just examples
  email: office@ory.com
  name:
    first: Aeneas
    last: Rekkas
  favorite_animal: Dog
  accepted_tos: true

# Public metadata is visible at the `/session/whoami` endpoint but cannot be modified by the users themselves.
metadata_public:
  any:
    valid: ["json"]
    example: 1

# Admin metadata only visible at administrative endpoints and cannot be modified by the users themselves.
metadata_admin:
  another:
    valid: ["yaml"]
    example: 2
```
