# Identity schema

The identity schema which is implements the [JSON Schema Standard](https://json-schema.org) is a powerful tool to bend Ory
Identities to your will. In terms of modifying user profile fields, the identity schema specifies the types of data that can be
stored about a user, such as their name, email address, phone number, and birthday. It may also define additional fields that can
be added to a user's profile, such as a job title, company name, or location. The identity schema not only defines the data model
of your identities, but also controls business logic:

- Define which field is used as the identifier when logging in, such as username, email, phone numbers, or a combination of those.
- Define fields which are used to verify or recover the user's identity, such as email, phone number, or a combination of those.

It is sometimes useful to have different identity schemas for different groups of users, such as customer support and end users.
This allows the system to tailor the user experience and security measures to the specific needs and requirements of each group.

The Ory Network provides default presets to help users get started with creating and managing identity schemas for their systems.

## Presets

The Ory Network provides three basic identity schema presets.

Identity schemas are a powerful tool with a learning curve. When getting started, choose one of the presets Ory provides to make
your life easier, and customize the identity schema to your needs later.

:::

### Email and password

With this preset, identities have a single trait, the `email`. The `email` is the login identifier and is used for email
verification and for account recovery:

```json5
// Identity example
{
  id: "6e9d3d30-f93e-4630-901f-c2096953723d",
  traits: {
    email: "foo@bar.com",
  },
}
```

### Username and password

This preset is useful for applications that don't need the user's email address and don't prioritize a high degree of user
anonymity.

:::info

Without an email, users can not send recovery links to their email. They will not be able to regain access to their account.

:::

With this preset, every identity has a single trait - the `username`. The `username` is the login identifier:

```json5
// Identity example
{
  id: "6e9d3d30-f93e-4630-901f-c2096953723d",
  traits: {
    username: "some-username",
  },
}
```

### Example with name and newsletter opt-in

This preset has an email field, a first name, last name, and a "newsletter" checkbox.

```json5
// Identity example
{
  id: "6e9d3d30-f93e-4630-901f-c2096953723d",
  traits: {
    email: "foo@bar.com",
    name: {
      first: "Foo",
      last: "Bar",
    },
    newsletter: true,
  },
}
```
