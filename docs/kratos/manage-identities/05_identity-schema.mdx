# Identity Schema

The Identity Schema is a JSON schema that describes the data model that makes up the identity. In Ory, every identity can have its
own model (a unique set of data fields).

## Available presets

The Ory Network provides three basic Identity Schema presets.

### Username and password

This preset is useful for applications that don't need the user's email address and don't prioritize a high degree of user
anonymity.

:::warning

This preset disables account verification, account recovery, and account enumeration defenses. Don't use it in security-sensitive
environments.

:::

With this preset, every identity has a single trait - the `username`. The `username` is the login identifier:

```json5
// Identity example
{
  id: "6e9d3d30-f93e-4630-901f-c2096953723d",
  traits: {
    username: "some-username",
  },
}
```

### Email and password

With this preset, identities have a single trait, the `email`. The `email` is the login identifier and is used for email
verification and for account recovery:

```json5
// Identity example
{
  id: "6e9d3d30-f93e-4630-901f-c2096953723d",
  traits: {
    email: "foo@bar.com",
  },
}
```

### Example with name and newsletter opt-in

This preset has an email field, a first name, last name, and a "newsletter" checkbox.

```json5
// Identity example
{
  id: "6e9d3d30-f93e-4630-901f-c2096953723d",
  traits: {
    email: "foo@bar.com",
    name: {
      first: "Foo",
      last: "Bar",
    },
    newsletter: true,
  },
}
```

## Identity Schema vocabulary extensions

Because the system doesn't know that a particular field has a system-relevant meaning, you have to specify that in the schema. For
example:

- This email address should be used for recovering a lost password.
- This identifier (username or email) should be used for logging in with a password.
- This is the phone number used for SMS 2FA.

A vocabulary extension can be used within a property:

```json5
{
  $id: "http://mydomain.com/schemas/v2/customer.schema.json",
  $schema: "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  title: "A customer (v2)",
  type: "object",
  properties: {
    traits: {
      type: "object",
      properties: {
        email: {
          title: "E-Mail",
          type: "string",
          format: "email",

          // This tells Ory Identities that the field should be used as the "username" for the username+password flow.
          // It's an extension to the regular JSON Schema vocabulary.
          "ory.sh/kratos": {
            credentials: {
              password: {
                identifier: true,
              },
            },
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

### Identifier for username and password flows

You can configure Ory Identities (Ory Kratos) to use specific fields as the identity's identifier. In this example, the `password`
is set as the identifier:

```json
{
  "ory.sh/kratos": {
    "credentials": {
      "password": {
        "identifier": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Email

Looking at the traits from above

```yaml
traits:
  # These are just examples
  email: office@ory.sh
  name:
    first: Aeneas
    last: Rekkas
  favorite_animal: Dog
  accepted_tos: true
```

and using a JSON Schema that uses the `email` field as the identifier for the password flow:

```json5
{
  $id: "http://mydomain.com/schemas/v2/customer.schema.json",
  $schema: "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  title: "A customer (v2)",
  type: "object",
  properties: {
    traits: {
      type: "object",
      properties: {
        email: {
          title: "E-Mail",
          type: "string",
          format: "email",

          // This tells Ory Identities that the field should be used as the "username" for the username and password flow.
          "ory.sh/kratos": {
            credentials: {
              password: {
                identifier: true,
              },
            },
          },
        },
        name: {
          type: "object",
          properties: {
            first: {
              type: "string",
            },
            last: {
              type: "string",
            },
          },
        },
        favorite_animal: {
          type: "string",
        },
        accepted_tos: {
          type: "string",
        },
      },
      required: ["email"],
      additionalProperties: false,
    },
  },
}
```

In this example, Ory understands that `traits.email='office@ory.sh'` is the identifier for this identity. The system must get
`office@ory.sh` and a password to sign in an user.

[Username and Password Credentials](../../kratos/concepts/credentials/username-email-password) contains more information and
examples about credentials usage.

Note that the `format` field of the Identity Schema will perform validation of the given trait. In this example, the email address
is validated using the [JSONSchema](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/string.html#email-addresses) rule
set.

#### Phone number

Let's extend the Identity Schema from the previous chapter with a phone number:

```json5
{
  $id: "http://mydomain.com/schemas/v2/customer.schema.json",
  $schema: "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  title: "A customer (v2)",
  type: "object",
  properties: {
    traits: {
      type: "object",
      properties: {
        email: {
          title: "E-Mail",
          type: "string",
          format: "email",

          // This tells Ory Identities that the field should be used as the "username" for the Username and Password Flow.
          "ory.sh/kratos": {
            credentials: {
              password: {
                identifier: true,
              },
            },
          },
        },
        phone: {
          title: "Phone",
          type: "string",
          format: "tel",

          // The phone number is marked as an identifier. This allows the user to log in with both email and phone number.
          "ory.sh/kratos": {
            credentials: {
              password: {
                identifier: true,
              },
            },
          },
        },
        name: {
          type: "object",
          properties: {
            first: {
              type: "string",
            },
            last: {
              type: "string",
            },
          },
        },
        favorite_animal: {
          type: "string",
        },
        accepted_tos: {
          type: "string",
        },
      },
      required: ["email"],
      additionalProperties: false,
    },
  },
}
```

By using the `"format": "tel"` field we enable validation of phone numbers using the Golang
[port](https://github.com/nyaruka/phonenumbers) of Google's [libphonenumber](https://github.com/google/libphonenumber).

## Examples

### Choosing between username, email, and phone Number

Before you start, you need to decide what data you want to collect from your users and why! It's hard to change this decision
afterwards, so make sure you've taken everything into account!

When logging in, the user will use a login identifier and a password to sign up and in. The identifier can be

- a username - "john.doe" or "johndoe123" or "oryuser",
- an email address - `john.doe@gmail.com`,
- a phone number - `+49-1234-4321-1234-4321`.

All of these approaches have up- and downsides.

Using the email address as the login identifier is easy to remember, doesn't require additional fields (because the email address
is already being collected), and is usually unique. It's usually unique because sometimes companies use a "shared" email account
(for example office@acme.org) to access services. In that case, multiple real identities are using the same email identifier to
log in.

The email address however represents a unique identifier and personally identifiable information (PII). An attacker could for
example check if the email address `john.doe@gmail.com` is registered at for example an adult website and use that information for
blackmail (see [Account Enumeration Attacks](../concepts/security.mdx#account-enumeration-attacks)).

The same considerations apply to using a phone number as the primary registration & login identifier.

Using a free text username reduces the privacy risk because it's much harder to make a connection between the username and a real
world identity. It's still possible in cases where users choose a username such as "john.doe.from.newyork.1970", but finding the
right username identifier is still difficult and there is plausible deniability because anyone could use that username.

A free text username however requires capturing additional fields (for example an email address for password resets / account
recovery) and is hard to remember. It's often very difficult to find unique usernames as people tend to use a combination of their
names and initials such as `john.doe` which has a high chance of collision. Therefore, one ends up with usernames such as
`john.doe1234432`.

It's important to understand that Ory Identities lowercases all `password` identifiers and therefore E-Mail addresses. Characters
`+` or `.` which have special meaning for some E-Mail Providers such as Gmail aren't normalized:

- `userNAME` is equal to `username`
- `foo@BaR.com` is equal to `foo@bar.com`
- `foo+baz@bar.com` is NOT equal to `foo@bar.com`
- `foo.baz@bar.com` is NOT equal to `foobaz@bar.com`

You need to decide which route you want to take.

### Pick the right identity schema

When processing an identity and its traits, the method will use [JSON Schema](../reference/json-schema-json-paths.md) to extract
one or more identifiers.

#### Use Case: Email and Password

To use the email address as the login identifier, define the following Identity JSON Schema:

```json
{
  "$id": "https://example.com/registration.schema.json",
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "title": "Person",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "traits": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "email": {
          "type": "string",
          "format": "email",
          "ory.sh/kratos": {
            "credentials": {
              "password": {
                "identifier": true
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Use case: multiple emails and password

You can allow users to sign up with multiple E-Mail Addresses and use any of those for log in:

```json
{
  "$id": "https://example.com/registration.schema.json",
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "title": "Person",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "traits": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "emails": {
          "type": "array",
          "items": {
            "type": "string",
            "format": "email",
            "ory.sh/kratos": {
              "credentials": {
                "password": {
                  "identifier": true
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Use case: username and password

To use a username as the login identifier, define the following Identity JSON Schema:

```json
{
  "$id": "https://example.com/registration.schema.json",
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "title": "Person",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "traits": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "username": {
          "type": "string",
          "ory.sh/kratos": {
            "credentials": {
              "password": {
                "identifier": true
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Use Case: username and email and password

You may also mix usernames and passwords:

```json
{
  "$id": "https://example.com/registration.schema.json",
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "title": "Person",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "traits": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "email": {
          "type": "string",
          "format": "email",
          "ory.sh/kratos": {
            "credentials": {
              "password": {
                "identifier": true
              }
            }
          }
        },
        "username": {
          "type": "string",
          "ory.sh/kratos": {
            "credentials": {
              "password": {
                "identifier": true
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Use case: phone number and password

```json
{
  "$id": "https://example.com/registration.schema.json",
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "title": "Person",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "traits": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "phone": {
          "type": "string",
          "format": "tel",
          "ory.sh/kratos": {
            "credentials": {
              "password": {
                "identifier": true
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
