# Identity schema

The identity schema is a powerful tool to bend Ory's identities to your will. With it you define not only the data model of your
identities, but also control business logic:

- Define which field is used as the identifier when logging in, such as username, email, phone numbers, or a combination of those.
- Define fields which are used to verify or recover the user's identity, such as email, phone number, or a combination of those.

The Ory Identity schema uses the [JSON Schema Standard](https://json-schema.org) and defines a few extensions to control business
logic. Every identity can have a separate schema, which allows you to have different data models for different use cases within
the same application:

- Customer account with a username, shipping address, phone number
- Support staff accounts with email, department, and a supervisor name

## Presets

The Ory Network provides three basic identity schema presets.

Identity schemas are a powerful tool with a learning curve. When getting started, choose one of the presets Ory provides to
make your life easier, and customize the identity schema to your needs later.

:::

### Email and password

With this preset, identities have a single trait, the `email`. The `email` is the login identifier and is used for email
verification and for account recovery:

```json5
// Identity example
{
  id: "6e9d3d30-f93e-4630-901f-c2096953723d",
  traits: {
    email: "foo@bar.com",
  },
}
```

### Username and password

This preset is useful for applications that don't need the user's email address and don't prioritize a high degree of user
anonymity.

:::info

Without an email, users can not send recovery links to their email. They will not be able to regain access to their account.

:::

With this preset, every identity has a single trait - the `username`. The `username` is the login identifier:

```json5
// Identity example
{
  id: "6e9d3d30-f93e-4630-901f-c2096953723d",
  traits: {
    username: "some-username",
  },
}
```

### Example with name and newsletter opt-in

This preset has an email field, a first name, last name, and a "newsletter" checkbox.

```json5
// Identity example
{
  id: "6e9d3d30-f93e-4630-901f-c2096953723d",
  traits: {
    email: "foo@bar.com",
    name: {
      first: "Foo",
      last: "Bar",
    },
    newsletter: true,
  },
}
```
