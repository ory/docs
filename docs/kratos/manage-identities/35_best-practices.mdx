# Identity schema best practices

Follow this guide to learn about best practices when creating custom identity schemas.

## Sensitive data

The identity schema isn't the right place to store data that should be obfuscated from the user. Users can see traits and other
data - except credentials - using the `/sessions/whoami` endpoint. Users are also able to edit identity traits.

:::info

Don't store sensitive internal data in the identity's traits. Use the `metadata_admin` field for this purpose.

Read [this document](./managing-users-identities-metadata) for information how to use metadata that can't be viewed or changed by
the end user.

## Keep your data lean

- **Do not** add too many fields to your identities. Keep the number of fields well below 15.
- **Do not** store business logic in your identities. Store this information in other systems. This includes credit card
  information, shipping addresses, shopping cart items, or user preferences.
- **Do** store profile data that is used across your system. This includes the usernames, email addresses, phone numbers, first
  names, and last names.

## Updating identity schemas

When using the Ory CLI and Ory configuration files, use versioning to keep track of changes to your identity schema. This allows
you to gradually update your identity schema without affecting existing identities.

Let's say that you just defined your first identity schema:

```yaml
identity:
  default_schema_id: user_v0
  schemas:
    - id: user_v0
      url: file://path/to/user_v0.json
```

After a few weeks, you decide that you want to add additional fields or that you need to break compatibility with your current
schema. To do that, add another version of the schema to the configuration and change the `default_schema_id` to use the new
schema:

```yaml
identity:
  default_schema_id: user_v1
  schemas:
    - id: user_v0
      url: base64://{b46-encoded-user_v0}
    - id: user_v1
      url: base64://{b46-encoded-user_v1}
```

With this configuration in place, existing identities work as expected and continue to use the `user_v0` identity schema. All
newly created identities will use `user_v1` schema.

When you're ready to migrate all identities that use the `user_v0` to the `user_v1` schema, use the REST API to list all
identities using the old version and perform the required data transformations.

## Sanitize usernames/traits

To make sure usernames or traits satisfy a specific regex (for example only alphanumeric characters), they can be sanitized. To
sanitize usernames add
[regular expressions](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/string.html#regular-expressions) to the identity
Schema. To sanitize usernames coming from third-party OIDC providers like Google or GitHub write [JSonnet](https://jsonnet.org).
