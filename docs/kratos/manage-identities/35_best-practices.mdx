# Identity schema best practices

Follow this guide to learn about best practices when creating custom identity schemas.

## Sensitive data in Identity Schema

:::info

Do not store sensitive internal data in the identity's traits. Use the `metadata_admin` field for this purpose.

:::

The Identity Schema isn't the right place to store data that should be obfuscated from the user. Users can see traits and other
data - except credentials - using the `/sessions/whoami` endpoint. Users are also able to edit identity traits.

Read [this document](./managing-users-identities-metadata) for information how to use metadata that can't be viewed or changed by
the end user.

## Keep your data lean

- **Do not** add too many fields to your identities. Keep the number of fields well below 15.
- **Do not** store business logic in your identities. Store this information (for example credit card information, shipping
  addresses, shopping cart items, user preferences, ...) in another 3rd party or 1st party system.
- **Do** store profile data that is needed everywhere in your system. For example, the user's name, email address, phone number,
  first name and last name, ...

## Updating Identity Schemas

When using the Ory CLI and Ory configuration files, use versioning to keep track of changes to your identity schema. This allows
you to gradually update your Identity Schema without affecting existing identities. Assume you just defined your first Identity
Schema:

```yaml
identity:
  default_schema_id: user_v0
  schemas:
    - id: user_v0
      url: file://path/to/user_v0.json
```

Weeks later you might notice that you want some additional fields, or want to break compatibility with your current schema. Just
add another version to the schema and change the `default_schema_id`:

```yaml
identity:
  default_schema_id: user_v1
  schemas:
    - id: user_v0
      url: file://path/to/user_v0.json
    - id: user_v1
      url: file://path/to/user_v1.json
```

All existing identities will continue to work as expected, having their Identity Schema ID be `user_v0`. All new identities will
user `user_v1`! If you are ready to do a migration, you can list all identities in your system with `user_v0` as the schema, and
update them to `user_v1` with the required data transformations using the REST APIs!

## Sanitize usernames/traits

To make sure usernames (or traits) satisfy a specific regex (for example only alphanumeric characters), they can be sanitized. To
sanitize usernames add
[Regular Expressions](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/string.html#regular-expressions) to the Identity
Schema. To sanitize usernames coming from third-party OIDC providers like Google or GitHub write [Jsonnet](https://jsonnet.org).
