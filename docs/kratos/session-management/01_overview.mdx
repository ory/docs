# Overview

```

When a user authenticates, for example by signing in with their username and password, they receive a session. The session is
proof that the user is authenticated and allows to interact with the system without the need to re-authenticate for every request.

Sessions can be issued in two formats:

- **Ory Session Cookie** - when the system detects that the interaction is performed through a web browser, a cookie which
  represents the user's session is stored in the browser.
- **Ory Session Token** - when the system detects that the interaction is performed by a client other than a web browser, for
  example a native mobile app, a session token is issued to the client.

:::note

For security reasons, you can't break the isolation between cookies and session tokens.

## Ory session

This is a sample session:

### Using Ory Session Cookie

An Ory Session Cookie is issued when the user signs in through the browser-based login flow. To get the session payload, send a
request to the `/sessions/whoami` endpoint.

:::note

Browser-based applications including single-page applications (SPAs) and server-side rendered apps should use session cookies
instead of session tokens.

### Using Ory Session Token

An Ory Session Token is issued when the user authenticates through a client other than a web browser. To get the session payload,
send a request to the `/sessions/whoami` endpoint.

:::note

Native applications such as desktop applications, mobile applications, or terminal-based apps that do not run inside a browser
should use session tokens instead of session cookies.

## JSON Web Token (JWT) support

:::warning

Ory doesn't issue sessions as JSON Web Tokens (JWTs).

:::

Sessions are not issued as JWTs for two main reasons:

1. Sessions can end at any point in time, indicating that the user is no longer signed in. With JWTs, it's difficult to determine
   if a session is still valid before the token expires.
2. Sessions can be updated and changed at any point in time, for example, when the user updates their profile. Such change can't
   be easily reflected in a JWT before it is refreshed.

Ory Network employs a session caching mechanism to reduce the latency for `toSession` / `/sessions/whoami` endpoint calls across
the globe so that latency is not an issue for users. [Read more about session caching.](../../concepts/cache.mdx)

If you don't want to make repeated calls to `toSession` / `/sessions/whoami`, or you need to use JWTs in your setup, you can
convert sessions to JWTs on your entry point. There, you could add caching to further reduce the amount of API calls made.

:::tip

[Ory Oathkeeper](https://www.ory.sh/oathkeeper) is an API Gateway capable of converting sessions to JWTs.
