title: Session management

Sessions can be managed by:

1. The user who owns the session through **self-service**
2. System administrators using **administrative endpoints**

## Self-service session management

Using self-service session management, users can manage their own sessions.

:::note

When performing these operations, remember to include the Ory Session Cookie in the requests. When calling the endpoints from a
proxy or middleware, make sure to forward the cookies sent to the proxy/middleware. When calling these endpoints as AJAX calls,
make sure to include credentials and configure CORS properly.

### Listing sessions

Users can list their sessions by sending a `GET` request to the `/sessions` endpoint or by using the `listSessions` SDK command:

```mdx-code-block
import { getSdkUrl } from '@site/src/hooks'
import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock'

<CodeBlock>{`GET ${getSdkUrl().url}/sessions
Cookies: ory_kratos_session=...
# OR
X-Session-Token: ...`}</CodeBlock>
```

This call returns a list af all of the user's active sessions that haven't expired, except the current session.

:::tip

You can use this call to show a UI with all active sessions to the user.

:::

### Revoking specific sessions

To revoke a specific session, the user must send a `DELETE` request to the
[`/sessions/{id}`](../../reference/api.mdx#operation/revokeSessionById) endpoint or use the `revokeSessionById` SDK command:

```mdx-code-block
<CodeBlock>{`DELETE ${getSdkUrl().url}/sessions/{id}
Cookies: ory_kratos_session=...
# OR
X-Session-Token: ...`}</CodeBlock>
```

Sessions revoked by users are not deleted from the system. Instead, they become inactive. Only administrators can delete sessions
using the administrative endpoints.

:::note

This endpoint revokes only sessions other than the current session. To revoke the current session, use the
[self-service logout](../../kratos/self-service/flows/user-logout.mdx).

:::

### Revoking all sessions

To revoke all sessions, the user must send a `DELETE` request to the
[`/sessions`](../../reference/api.mdx#operation/revokeSessions) endpoint or use the `revokeSessions` SDK command:

```mdx-code-block
<CodeBlock>{`DELETE ${getSdkUrl().url}/sessions
Cookies: ory_kratos_session=...
# OR
X-Session-Token: ...`}</CodeBlock>
```

## Administrative session management

System administrators have access to all sessions in the system.

### Listing Sessions

To get all sessions of a specific identity, administrators must send a `GET` request to the administrative
[`/admin/identities/{id}/sessions`](../../reference/api.mdx#operation/adminListIdentitySessions) endpoint.

```mdx-code-block
<CodeBlock>{`GET ${getSdkUrl().url}/admin/identities/{id}/sessions
Authorization: Bearer {your-personal-access-token}`}</CodeBlock>
```

### Revoke sessions as an administrator

To revoke all sessions of a specific identity, administrators must send a `DELETE` request to the administrative
[`/admin/identities/{id}/sessions`](../../reference/api.mdx#operation/adminDeleteIdentitySessions) endpoint.

```mdx-code-block
<CodeBlock>{`DELETE ${getSdkUrl().url}/admin/identities/{id}/sessions
Authorization: Bearer {your-personal-access-token}`}</CodeBlock>
```

:::note

This operation forcefully logs the user out of all their sessions and deletes all session data.
