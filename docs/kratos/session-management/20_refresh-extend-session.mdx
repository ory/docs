For certain use cases, sessions need to be refreshed on user activity or administrative action.

When you refresh a session, its `expires` property is set to a value that is the time when the refresh is triggered plus the
amount of time defined by the value of `/session/lifespan`.

## Forcing session refresh

You can force users to refresh session by prompting them to re-authenticate by interacting with the
[`/self-service/login/browser`](../../reference/api.mdx#operation/initializeSelfServiceLoginFlowForBrowsers) or
[`/self-service/login/api`](../../reference/api.mdx#operation/initializeSelfServiceLoginFlowWithoutBrowser) APIs and setting the
`refresh` parameter to true.

When the user re-authenticates, the `authenticated_at` timestamp of the session is set to the time when user re-authenticated.

```mdx-code-block
<CodeBlock language="shell">{`${getSdkUrl().url}/self-service/login/browser?refresh=true`}</CodeBlock>
```

When forcing users to refresh sessions, you can also force them to refresh their second authentication factor. To do that, set
`refresh=true` and `aal=aal2`:

```mdx-code-block
<CodeBlock language="shell">{`${getSdkUrl().url}/self-service/login/browser?refresh=true&aal=aal2`}</CodeBlock>
```

## Refreshing sessions as administrator

Administrators can refresh the session of a specific user using the
[extend session API](../../reference/api#tag/identity/operation/extendSession) from the SDK.

```

:::tip

To get the Session ID, call the `/sessions/whoami` endpoint or `toSession` SDK method.

## Refresh threshold

You can limit the time in which the session can be refreshed by adjusting the `earliest_possible_extend` configuration.

For example, if you set `earliest_possible_extend` to `24h`, sessions can't be refreshed sooner than 24 hours before they expire.

If you need high flexibility when extending sessions, you can set `earliest_possible_extend` to `lifespan`, which allows sessions
to be refreshed during their entire lifespan, even right after they are created.

:::danger

If you set `earliest_possible_extend` to `lifespan`, all sessions will constantly be refreshed!

1. Download the Ory Identities config from your project and save it to a file:

   ```shell
   ## List all available projects
   ory list projects

   ## Get config
   ory get identity-config {project-id} --format yaml > identity-config.yaml
   ```

2. Update the configuration value for the property to the desired value. (Use hour (h), minute (m), second (s) to define interval, for example: 1h1m10s, 10s, 1h)

   ```yaml title="config.yml"
   session:
   cookie:
      domain: $PROJECT_SLUG.projects.oryapis.com
      name: ory_session_{name}
      path: /
      persistent: false
      same_site: Lax
   lifespan: 720h0m0s
   // highlight-start
   earliest_possible_extend: 24h0m0s
   // highlight-end
   ```

3. Update the Ory Identities configuration using the file you worked with:

   ```shell
   ory update identity-config {project-id} --file identity-config.yaml
   ```

</TabItem>
