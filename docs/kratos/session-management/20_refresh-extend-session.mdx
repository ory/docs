title: Refresh and extend sessions
---

For certain use cases, sessions need to be refreshed on user activity or administrative action.

When you refresh a session, its `expires` property is set to a value that is the time when the refresh is triggered plus the
amount of time defined by the value of `/session/lifespan`.

## Refresh sessions as administrator

To extend a session's lifespan, call the administrative
[`adminRefreshSession`](../../reference/api.mdx#operation/adminRefreshSession) endpoint with the session ID:

```mdx-code-block
import { getSdkUrl } from '@site/src/hooks'
import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock'

<CodeBlock>{`PATCH ${getSdkUrl().url}/admin/sessions/{id}/refresh
Authorization: Bearer {your-personal-access-token}`}</CodeBlock>
```

:::tip

To get the Session ID, call the `/sessions/whoami` endpoint or `toSession` SDK method.

:::

## Reduce database load

Refreshing sessions causes database writes.

To reduce the database load, you can limit the time in which the session can be refreshed by adjusting the
`earliest_possible_extend` configuration.

For example, if you set `earliest_possible_extend` to `24h`, sessions can't be refreshed no sooner than 24 hours before they expire. This
setting prevents putting excessive load on the database.

If you need high flexibility when extending sessions, you can set `earliest_possible_extend` to `lifespan`, which allows sessions
to be refreshed during their entire lifespan, even right after they are created.

:::warning

If you set `earliest_possible_extend` to `lifespan`, all sessions will constantly be refreshed!
