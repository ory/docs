Multi-factor authentication (MFA) provides an additional layer of security that helps ensure that the accounts of your users can't
be easily compromised by malicious actors.

Nowadays, many of the passwords in use can be easily compromised because:

- They are re-used across multiple websites and applications
- They were leaked to the web and sold to malicious actors
- They are considered "weak" by being short, having obvious, derivable patterns, containing easy-to-guess character strings, etc.

By enabling two-factor authentication in your project, you introduce an additional verification step that can guard user login or
user self-service, such as updating account information or credentials, against malicious actors.

## Available methods

Ory offers multiple second-factor authentication methods for all projects and self-hosted instances:

### Time-based one-time password (TOTP)

Time-based one-time passwords are codes of a few digits, that are only valid for a short amount of time, usually 30 seconds or
less. It requires users to use a companion app such as [Google Authenticator](https://g.co/kgs/YgRFR5) or the OnePassword password
manager to generate these codes. Read more on [Time-based one-time passwords (TOTP)](./15_totp.mdx).

### WebAuthn

This method uses the [Web Authentication API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Authentication_API) of the
browser, also known as WebAuthn, which allows servers to register and authenticate users using public-key cryptography. Read more
on [WebAuthn and FIDO2 (YubiKey)](./20_webauthn-fido-yubikey.mdx)

### Lookup Secrets

Lookup Secrets, also known as Backup Codes or Recovery Codes, are a 2FA fail-safe mechanism, rather than a standalone two-factor
authentication method. They can be used to complete the second factor when users lose access to their selected 2FA method. Read
more on [Lookup Secrets (Recovery Codes)](./25_lookup-secrets.mdx).

### Authentication Method Reference (AMR)

The Authentication Method Reference (AMR) is an array of authentication methods used over the lifetime of an Ory Session.

The following methods can be present in a session:

- `password` - When the user authenticated with their password.
- `oidc`- When the user authenticated by signing in with a social sign-in provider
- `totp`- When the user authenticated by entering a time-based one-time password
- `webauthn` - When the user authenticated through an OS-level biometric authentication method (WebAuthn)
- `lookup_secret` - When the user entered a valid one-time recovery code

This is how the information is presented in the Ory Session, for example when fetching the session from the Ory Identities API:

```json5 title="Sample Ory Session JSON Payload"
{
  id: "6b51a3f2-6a2c-4557-90a8-4e23de7072aa",
  active: true,
  // ...
  authenticator_assurance_level: "aal2",
  authentication_methods: [
    {
      method: "password",
      completed_at: "2021-10-14T09:37:53.872104Z",
    },
    {
      method: "lookup_secret",
      completed_at: "2021-10-14T09:41:16.771859Z",
    },
  ],
  // ...
}
```

If a user authenticates multiple times over the lifetime of the same session with the same method, every successful attempt will
be present in the session:

```json5 title="Sample Ory Session JSON Payload"
{
  id: "6b51a3f2-6a2c-4557-90a8-4e23de7072aa",
  active: true,
  // ...
  authenticator_assurance_level: "aal2",
  authentication_methods: [
    {
      method: "password",
      completed_at: "2021-10-14T09:37:53.872104Z",
    },
    {
      method: "lookup_secret",
      completed_at: "2021-10-14T09:41:16.771859Z",
    },
    {
      method: "password",
      completed_at: "2021-10-14T12:00:00.134567Z",
    },
  ],
  // ...
}
```

### Authenticator Assurance Level (AAL)

The Authenticator Assurance Level (AAL) indicates how many authentication factors the identity has completed.

Authentication methods are classified into factors:

| Authentication method | Factor |
| :-------------------- | :----- |
| `password`            | first  |
| `oidc`                | first  |
| `totp`                | second |
| `webauthn`            | second |
| `lookup_secret`       | second |

:::info

If you enable `webauthn` for [passwordless authentication](../passwordless/webauthn) it is not considered as a second
authentication factor.

:::

The parameter can take one of two values:

- `aal1`: The Identity completed only the first authentication factor(s).
- `aal2`: The Identity completed the first and the second authentication factor(s).

:::warning

Completing two first authentication factors doesn't give the Identity `aal2`. For example, logging in with a `password` and `oidc`
is still `aal2`.
