```

SMS can be used to deliver one time codes to users. Ory will deliver a 6-digit code to an SMS gateway of your choice, such as
Twilio, Amazon SNS or your own application. These codes are valid for a short amount of time, usually 15 minutes or less. Once the
user completes the challenge, by entering the code, the AAL of the session is upgraded to AAL2.

:::note

Ory currently only supports either MFA via SMS or passwordless login via code, not both.

## Configuration

To enable MFA via SMS, you need to configure an SMS channel in the Ory configuration:

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs groupId="console-or-cli">
<TabItem value="cli" label="Ory CLI" default>
```

1. Get the Ory Identities configuration from your project and save it to a file:

   ```shell
   ## List all available projects
   ory list projects

   ## Get config
   ory get identity-config {project-id} --format yaml > identity-config.yaml
   ```

2. Find `code` in `selfservice.methods` and set `mfa_enabled` to `true`:

   ```yaml title="identity-config.yaml"
   code:
     mfa_enabled: true
   ```

3. Update the Ory Identities configuration using the file you worked with:

   ```shell
   ory update identity-config {project-id} --file identity-config.yaml
   ```

```mdx-code-block
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

## Integration

To be able to send codes via SMS, you need to provide a custom SMS sender. Ory simply sends the code, the phone number and other
metadata to a webhook of your choice. Please read the [SMS documentation](../emails-sms/10_sending-sms.mdx).

To start a new MFA flow, for an already existing session, create a new login flow with the `aal` parameter set to `aal2`. You'll
also need to specify which trait to use for delivering the code to the user. Make sure, this trait exists in the identity schema
and set the `via` parameter to its identifier. For example, if you have a trait called `phone_number`, you'd set `via` to
`phone_number`.

Ory will return an error in the UI, if the trait does not exist in the identity's schema or the trait is empty in the current
identity. So make sure this trait is required in your identity schema.
