# Configure MFA in your application

You can enforce multi-factor authentication in one of two models:

- **Strict**, where secured operations always require the highest Authenticator Assurance Level (AAL).
- **Lax**, where the secured operations require only the `aal1` Authenticator Assurance Level (AAL).

You can set the required authentication model for these operations/endpoints:

- User sign-in (getting an Ory Session) / `/sessions/whoami` endpoint
- Self-service user settings

## Configuration

Follow these steps to enforce multi-factor authentication:

````mdx-code-block
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="console" label="Ory Console" default>

In the Ory Network, the default multi-factor authentication enforcement model is Strict.

To change it to Lax and allow users to sign in or access user settings without authenticating with the second factor, go to the
**Ory Console** â†’ [**Two-Factor Authentication**](https://console.ory.sh/projects/current/mfa) and use the switches in the **General Settings** section.

  ```mdx-code-block
  import BrowserWindow from "@site/src/theme/BrowserWindow"

  <BrowserWindow url="https://console.ory.sh/">

  ![Authentication enforcement settings in Ory Console](../_static/mfa/10.png)

  </BrowserWindow>
  ```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="cli" label="Ory CLI" default>

Follow these steps to adjust the settings in The Ory Network using the Ory CLI:

1. Get the Ory Identities configuration from your project and save it to a file:

   ```shell
   ## List all available projects
   ory list projects

   ## Get config
   ory get identity-config <project-id> --format yaml > identity-config.yaml
   ```

2. Adjust the values of the indicated keys to the desired values:

   ```yaml title="identity-config.yaml"
   # ...
   selfservice:
     flows:
       settings:
         required_aal: aal1
   # ...
   session:
     whoami:
       required_aal: aal1
   # ...
   ```

   :::tip

   Use `aal1` for the Lax model and `highest_available` for the Strict model.

   :::

3. Update the Ory Identities configuration using the file you worked with:

   ```shell
   ory update identity-config <project-id> --file identity-config.yaml
   ```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
````

## Requiring MFA for a session

Some actions in your application might require a session, that has provided a second factor.

To do that, initiate a new login flow using one of these endpoints with the `aal` parameter set to `aal2`:

- [`/self-service/login/browser`](../../reference/api.mdx#operation/initializeSelfServiceLoginFlowForBrowsers)
- [`/self-service/login/api`](../../reference/api.mdx#operation/initializeSelfServiceLoginFlowWithoutBrowser)

```shell
/self-service/login/browser?aal=aal2
/self-service/login/api?aal=aal2
```

When the user successfully provides their configured second factor:

- The method, for example `totp`, is added to the Ory Session.
- Ory Session Authenticator Assurance Level (AAL) is set to `aal2`.
- The `authenticated_at` time is set to the time when the user provides the second factor.

:::note

If the Ory Session has `aal2` already, this will error. In that case, you can request to refresh the session using the second
factor:

```shell
/self-service/login/browser?refresh=true&aal=aal2
/self-service/login/api?refresh=true&aal=aal2
```
