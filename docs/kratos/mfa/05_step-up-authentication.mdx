# Step-up authentication

```mdx-code-block
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
import BrowserWindow from "@site/src/theme/BrowserWindow"
```

You can set up multi-factor authentication to work in one of two models:

- **Strict**, where secured operations always require the highest Authenticator Assurance Level (AAL).
- **Lax**, where the secured operations require only the `aal1` Authenticator Assurance Level (AAL).

In Ory Network, the default multi-factor authentication enforcement model is **Strict**. This means that high-risk operations via
self-service endpoints, such as updating user settings, require step-up authentication by default.

You can set the required authentication model for these operations/endpoints:

- User sign-in (getting an Ory Session) / `/sessions/whoami` endpoint
- Self-service user settings

## Configuration

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="console" label="Ory Console" default>
```

To change the multi-factor authentication enforcement to Lax and allow users to sign in or access user settings without
authenticating with the second factor, go to <ConsoleLink route="project.mfa" /> and use the switches in the **General Settings**
section.

```mdx-code-block
<BrowserWindow url="https://console.ory.sh/">

![Step-up authentication settings in Ory Console](../_static/mfa/10.png)

</BrowserWindow>
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="cli" label="Ory CLI">
```

Follow these steps to adjust the settings in the Ory Network using the Ory CLI:

1. Get the Ory Identities configuration from your project and save it to a file:

   ```shell
   ## List all available projects
   ory list projects

   ## Get config
   ory get identity-config {project-id} --format yaml > identity-config.yaml
   ```

2. Adjust the values of the indicated keys to the desired values:

   ```yaml title="identity-config.yaml"
   # ...
   selfservice:
     flows:
       settings:
         required_aal: highest_available
   # ...
   session:
     whoami:
       required_aal: highest_available
   # ...
   ```

   :::tip

   Use `aal1` for the Lax model and `highest_available` for the Strict model. The default value in Ory Network is
   `highest_available`.

   :::

3. Update the Ory Identities configuration using the file you worked with:

   ```shell
   ory update identity-config {project-id} --file identity-config.yaml
   ```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

## Trigger Dynamic Multi-Factor authentication

To protect your application's sensitive functions - like accessing payment details, an order history, or private content - you can
make users complete a second authentication factor in their current session by initiating a new login flow using one of these
endpoints with the `aal` parameter set to `aal2`:

- [`/self-service/login/browser`](../../reference/api.mdx#operation/initializeSelfServiceLoginFlowForBrowsers)
- [`/self-service/login/api`](../../reference/api.mdx#operation/initializeSelfServiceLoginFlowWithoutBrowser)

For example:

```shell
/self-service/login/browser?aal=aal2
/self-service/login/api?aal=aal2
```

:::note

If the Ory Session has `aal2` already, this will error. In that case, you can request to refresh the session using the second
factor:

```shell
/self-service/login/browser?refresh=true&aal=aal2
/self-service/login/api?refresh=true&aal=aal2
```

:::

When the user successfully provides their configured second factor:

- The method, for example `totp`, is added to the Ory Session.
- Ory Session Authenticator Assurance Level (AAL) is set to `aal2`.
- The `authenticated_at` time is set to the time when the user provides the second factor.
