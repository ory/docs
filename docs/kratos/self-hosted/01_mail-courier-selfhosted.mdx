This document describes the behaviors and requirements of the mail courier that are applicable only when running a self-hosted
instance of Ory Kratos.

## How many couriers should you run?

Ory Kratos processes email dispatch using a mail courier worker, which must run as a singleton in order to process the mail queue.
It can be run as a background worker on a single-instance Kratos setup or as a distinct singleton foreground worker in
multi-instance deployments.

### Single-instance setup

To run the mail courier in the background on your single Kratos instance, add the `--watch-courier` flag to your `kratos serve`
command, as outlined in the [CLI docs](../cli/kratos-serve.md)

### Multi-instance setup

If you're running multiple instances of Kratos (for example replicated Kubernetes deployment), you need to run the mail courier as
a separate singleton job. The courier can be started with the `kratos courier watch` command
([CLI docs](../cli/kratos-courier.md)).

## Template override path

`email.subject.gotmpl`, `email.body.gotmpl` and `email.body.plaintext.gotmpl` are common template file names expected in the sub
directories of the root directory, corresponding to the respective methods for filling e-mail subject and body. Both plain text
and HTML templates are required. The courier uses them as
[alternatives](https://github.com/ory/kratos/blob/871ee0475a27771dd6395aad617f41a22ccc3b9a/courier/courier.go#L205) for fallback.

:::tip

If you're running multiple instances of Kratos and separate courier job, make sure to provide templates to all instances (both
Kratos and courier).

## Error handling

The `message_retries` parameter defines the number of times the mail courier attempts to deliver a message. This setting applies
to both the SMTP server and the SMS gateway. By default, `message_retries` is set to `5`.

If the courier can't deliver the message within the number of retries specified in `message_retries`, the message gets the
`Abandoned` status and the courier stops trying to deliver it.

```yaml title="path/to/my/kratos/config.yml"
# kratos -c path/to/my/kratos/config.yml serve
courier:
  message_retries: 5
```

## Custom SMTP headers

You can configure custom SMTP headers. For example, if integrating with AWS SES SMTP interface, the headers can be configured for
cross-account sending:

```yaml title="path/to/my/kratos/config.yml"
# kratos -c path/to/my/kratos/config.yml serve
courier:
  smtp:
    headers:
      X-SES-SOURCE-ARN: arn:aws:ses:us-west-2:123456789012:identity/example.com
      X-SES-FROM-ARN: arn:aws:ses:us-west-2:123456789012:identity/example.com
      X-SES-RETURN-PATH-ARN: arn:aws:ses:us-west-2:123456789012:identity/example.com
```

## Certificate-based authentication

If your SMTP server enforces certificate based authentication, you can configure the client certificate and client private key to
use to connect to the server. The files must contain PEM encoded data:

```yaml title="path/to/my/kratos/config.yml"
# kratos -c path/to/my/kratos/config.yml serve
courier:
  smtp:
    client_cert_path: /somepath/client.cert
    client_key_path: /somepath/client.key
```

## Custom SMTP HELO/EHLO identifier

If your SMTP server requires a unique identifier for the HELO/EHLO command, you can configure the identifier. Some SMTP relays
(e.g. Gmail / Google Workspace) may close the connection for generic identifiers like `localhost`. The identifier should usually
be the domain name of the sending host. If the identifier is not configured, `localhost` is used per default.

```yaml title="path/to/my/kratos/config.yml"
courier:
  smtp:
    local_name: exmaple.org
```
