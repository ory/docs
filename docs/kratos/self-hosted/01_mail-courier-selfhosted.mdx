This document describes the behaviors and requirements of the mail courier that are applicable only when running a self-hosted instance of 
Ory Kratos.

## How many couriers should you run?

Ory Kratos processes email dispatch using a mail courier worker, which must run as a singleton in order to process the mail queue.
It can be run as a background worker on a single-instance Kratos setup or as a distinct singleton foreground worker in
multi-instance deployments.

### Single-instance setup

To run the mail courier in the background on your single Kratos instance, add the `--watch-courier` flag to your `kratos serve`
command, as outlined in the [CLI docs](../cli/kratos-serve.md)

### Multi-instance setup

If you're running multiple instances of Kratos (for example replicated Kubernetes deployment), you need to run the mail courier as
a separate singleton job. The courier can be started with the `kratos courier watch` command
([CLI docs](../cli/kratos-courier.md)).

## Template override path

`email.subject.gotmpl`, `email.body.gotmpl` and `email.body.plaintext.gotmpl` are common template file names expected in the sub
directories of the root directory, corresponding to the respective methods for filling e-mail subject and body. Both plain text
and HTML templates are required. The courier uses them as
[alternatives](https://github.com/ory/kratos/blob/871ee0475a27771dd6395aad617f41a22ccc3b9a/courier/courier.go#L205) for fallback.

:::tip

If you're running multiple instances of Kratos and separate courier job, make sure to provide templates to all instances (both
Kratos and courier).
