## Enforce MFA

When working with self-hosted instances of the Ory Identities (Kratos), change the enforcement model by adjusting these keys in
the configuration file.

The following will require users to provide the highest factor they have provided, to access their identity's settings. For
example, a user without a configured second factor will be able to access the settings after logging in with a password. A user
that has a second factor set-up (such as a TOTP app), will be required to complete the second factor challenge, before they can
access their settings.

It will also allow users to use your application without completing a second factor.

```yaml title="config.yml"
# ...
selfservice:
  flows:
    settings:
      required_aal: highest_available
# ...
session:
  whoami:
    required_aal: aal1
# ...
```

If instead, you want all users that configured a second factor to complete the factor before using your app, set
`session.whoami.required_all` to `highest_available`.

## WebAuthn

To configure WebAuthn in your self-hosted Kratos instance, add the `webauthn` method to `selfservice.methods` in the Ory Kratos
configuration file:

```yaml title="kratos.config.yml"
selfservice:
  methods:
    webauthn:
      config:
        passwordless: false
        rp:
          display_name: SAMPLE_NAME
          # Set 'id' to the top-level domain.
          id: loginpage.com
          # Set 'origin' to the exact URL of the page that prompts the user to use WebAuthn. You must include the scheme, host, and port.
          origin: https://loginpage.auth.com:4455
      enabled: true
```

:::note

Pay special attention to the `origin` URL, as it has to match the actual scheme, host and port of the page you're starting the
flow from.

## TOTP

To configure TOTP in your self-hosted Kratos instance, add the `totp` method to `selfservice/methods` in the configuration file:

```yaml title="kratos.config.yml"
selfservice:
  methods:
    totp:
      config:
        # The "issuer" is the name in the TOTP application users see when getting a one-time password.
        issuer: ExampleIssuerForSelfHosted.com
      enabled: true
```

## Lookup secrets

To configure lookup secrets, add the `lookup_secret` method to `selfservice/methods` in the configuration file:

```yaml title="kratos.config.yml"
selfservice:
  methods:
    lookup_secret:
      enabled: true
```
