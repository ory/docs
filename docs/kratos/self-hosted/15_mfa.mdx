## Enforce MFA

When working with self-hosted instances of the Ory Identities (Kratos), change the enforcement model by adjusting the
configuration file.

```yaml title="config.yml"
# ...
selfservice:
  flows:
    settings:
      required_aal: highest_available
# ...
session:
  whoami:
    required_aal: aal1
# ...
```

This configuration forces users to provide the highest authentication factor to access their account settings. For example, users
without a second factor configured can access the settings after they sign in with their password. Users that have a second factor
set up (such as a TOTP app) will must complete the second factor challenge to access account settings.

It will also allow users to use your application without completing a second factor.

If instead, you want all users that configured a second factor to complete the factor before using your app, set
`session.whoami.required_aal` to `highest_available`.

## WebAuthn

To configure WebAuthn in your self-hosted Kratos instance, add the `webauthn` method to `selfservice.methods` in the Ory Kratos
configuration file:

```yaml title="kratos.config.yml"
selfservice:
  methods:
    webauthn:
      config:
        passwordless: false
        rp:
          display_name: SAMPLE_NAME
          # Set 'id' to the top-level domain.
          id: loginpage.com
          # Set 'origin' to the exact URL of the page that prompts the user to use WebAuthn. You must include the scheme, host, and port.
          origin: https://loginpage.auth.com:4455
      enabled: true
```

:::note

Pay special attention to the `origin` URL, as it has to match the scheme, host, and port of the page you're starting the flow
from.

## Time-based one-time passwords (TOTP)

To configure TOTP in your self-hosted Kratos instance, add the `totp` method to `selfservice/methods` in the configuration file:

```yaml title="kratos.config.yml"
selfservice:
  methods:
    totp:
      config:
        # The "issuer" is the name in the TOTP application users see when getting a one-time password.
        issuer: ExampleIssuerForSelfHosted.com
      enabled: true
```

## Lookup Secrets (Recovery Codes)

To configure lookup secrets, add the `lookup_secret` method to `selfservice/methods` in the configuration file:

```yaml title="kratos.config.yml"
selfservice:
  methods:
    lookup_secret:
      enabled: true
```
