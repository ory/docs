Ory is a software infrastructure provider building a global zero-trust network for humans, robots, devices, and software services.
Ory develops open-source software on [GitHub](https://github.com/ory) and publishes open standards such as the
[Ory Permission Language](https://github.com/ory/keto/blob/master/docs/ory_permission_language_spec.md).
[The Ory Network](https://console.ory.sh/) uses cloud-native open-source technologies (Kubernetes, Crossplane, Cockroach, Linux,
Ory) and standards (OAuth 2.0/2.1, OpenID Connect, MITREid, WebAuthn, TOTP, FIDO3) to deliver a low-latency, planet-scale
zero-trust infrastructure. Ory combines centuries of open-source, security, operational, and industry expertise with a
user-centric and security-first mindset.

Core infrastructure components of [The Ory Network](https://console.ory.sh) are open source to foster collaboration, reduce supply
chain risk, broaden access to secure services, and introduce the open standard for internet security. Being open source Ory
improves the safety of everyone:

- Ory Identities offers a secure and modern central identity management solution with MFA, paswordless, WebAuthn, and more. It is
  based on the open-source [Ory Kratos Identity Server](https://github.com/ory/kratos).
- Ory OAuth2 & OpenID Connect implements 15+ IETF and OpenID standards to facilitate single-sign on, delegation and API access
  authorization. It is based on the open-source [Ory Hydra Federation Server](https://github.com/ory/hydra). implementing 15+ IETF
  and OpenID standards.
- Ory Permissions is a low-latency, high-performance, relationship-based authorization system that enables fine-grained access
  control (incl. RBAC and ABAC models) in any application. It is based on the open-source
  [Ory Keto Permission Server](https://github.com/ory/keto), which implements
  [Zanzibar: Googleâ€™s Consistent, Global Authorization System](https://research.google/pubs/pub48190/).

Ory develops and maintains many additional open-source projects. From an Ory Zero Trust Identity & Access Proxy
[Ory Oathkeeper](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper) to developer tooling [Ory Dockertest](https://github.com/ory/dockertest) to
language-specific libraries [Ory Ladon](https://github.com/ory/ladon). Ory has
[170+ open-source repositories](https://github.com/orgs/ory/repositories) and over 35.000 GitHub stars.

Ory is production ready, on track to secure 1,000,000,000,000 API requests in 2022, running in over 50.000 live deployments, and
improved hourly.

## Why Ory is different

Ory differentiates from other vendors in the following key areas:

- Our core services and APIs are developed and licensed under Apache 2.0, allowing you to participate, collaborate, and understand
  the inner workings of Ory.
- You can bring your own UI, in the programming language of your choosing, with the user experience that you like.
- From designing Identity Schemas using JSON Schema, to webhooks, to advanced configuration options - Ory is the most customizable
  platform out there.
- Ory spans the whole authentication and authorization universe with well-designed products and APIs:
- Identity Management with session management, flows for login, registration, account recovery & verification, mfa, and many more.
- Permission and Role Management.
- Delegation via OAuth2 and OpenID Connect.
- Zero Trust Networking.
- Modern API design with partial support for gRPC.

## The Ory Network

The Ory Network is the commercial offering of Ory and is built on top of our popular open-source software. Our goal with The Ory
Network is to offer a planet-scale, low-latency, resilient, and secure service that's easy to use and set up.

In short: The Ory Network is the most convenient and straightforward way to run Ory. Sign up at
[console.ory.sh](https://console.ory.sh/registration) for an account and create a free developer project.

### Components

The Ory Network uses a variety of components - some are based on open-source projects and others are closed source.

### Ory Console

Ory Console is the management UI of The Ory Network. It offers capabilities such as showing and searching for identities, managing
user sessions, and gaining valuable insights in the form of dashboards and customization.

### Ory Account Experience

Ory Account Experience implements screens such as login, registration, account recovery, account setting, and account
verification. This allows for fast adoption of Ory.

Contrary to other vendors, Ory allows you to implement your own (login, registration, ...) UI by offering simple, headless APIs.

### Identity & session services

The Ory Network incorporates the open-source [Ory Kratos Identity Server](https://www.ory.sh/kratos) project and offers:

- **Self-service** flows are everything users do on their own / without the help of others:
- Registration with passwords, social sign in, OpenID Connect, ...
- Login with passwords, social sign in, OpenID Connect, ...
- Updating the profile, email, changing the password, un/linking with Social. Sign In providers, ...
- Recovering the account by resetting the password.
- Verifying email addresses, phone numbers, ....
- Multi-factor authentication flows and recovery processes.
- **Administrative identity management** to get, create, update, delete identities (users) and their data.
- **Headless APIs and data models** allow you to fully customize Identity Schemas (for example adding fields like first name,
  accept tos, shipping address, gender, ...) and create your own login, registration, profile settings, recovery, and verification
  screen using our easy to use SDKs and REST APIs.

### Permission services

The Ory Network incorporates the open-source [Ory Keto Permission Server](https://www.ory.sh/keto) project and offers:

- **Permission management** to get, create, update, and delete permissions.
- **Permission checking** to check if a user has a permission.

## Ory open source

Ory is the largest open source ecosystem in the area of authentication, authorization, access control, and zero trust networking
in the world. Ory is not another company "greenwashing" with open source by publishing SDKs under open-source licenses. Instead,
all of our core systems are available as Apache 2.0 licensed software without enterprise or open core models.

Head over to the [Ory Open Source Overview](./open-source.mdx) for an introduction to the different projects.

### Is open source taking a back seat?

**No!** The Ory Network is our commercial offering with which we generate revenue to build more open source and more features in
Ory Network. Our value proposition and vision for The Ory Network is to incorporate and advance the open-source ecosystem and add
additional services which aren't possible to open source (for example analytics, SLAs, SRE, low-latency).

The Ory Network and our open-source software are interlinked. While we've made some modifications to the open source to make it
work better in our multi-tenant environment and operational (SRE) model, we're using the same code base, APIs, features, and
configurations for The Ory Network.

In the future, we will increase our open-source footprint, make the projects easier to modify, use, access, and distribute. The
only impact The Ory Network will have is that it will accelerate development and enable us to spend more resources on the open
source!
