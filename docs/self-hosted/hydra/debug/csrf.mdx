### Same-site in Chrome

Google Chrome changed the behavior of `SameSite=None` so that it isn't possible to use this SameSite mode without the HTTP Cookie
`secure` flag.

If you run a version of Ory Hydra 1.6 and below and experience this issue:

- Make sure to not use the `--dev` flag
- Set configuration value `serve.cookies.same_site_mode` or environment variable `SERVE_COOKIES_SAME_SITE_MODE` to `Lax` - this
happens automatically for Ory Hydra v1.7.0 when running in HTTP mode.

Chrome rejects cookies without the `secure` flag if a cookie with the same name for the same scope (domain, path) is set that has
the `secure` flag. Ory Hydra 1.7.0+ uses different names for cookies with and without `secure` flag. For versions prior to that,
you need to delete the cookies for the domain in order to get them working again.

### Ory Hydra Running Over HTTP Without dev-mode Enabled

You are running Ory Hydra via HTTP but are missing the `--dev` CLI flag:

```
hydra serve all -c path/to/config.yml --dev
```

### Mixing up `127.0.0.1` and `localhost`

Use either `127.0.0.1` or `localhost` - so either IPs or hostnames - throughout your flow because cookies from an IP aren't
available to the hostname and vice-versa.

### Reverse proxy or load balancers

You are running Ory Hydra behind a reverse proxy that strips the Cookie header. If the reverse proxy supports path rewrites that
might also cause issues!
