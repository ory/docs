# Reverting Database Migration for Ory Hydra

This guide outlines the steps to revert a database migration in Ory Hydra using the custom jobs functionality provided in the Ory
Hydra Helm chart. Reverting a migration can be essential when a schema change needs to be undone due to errors or unexpected
issues. This method leverages your existing production configuration, with only the migration arguments being customized.

:::note

All other parameters - such as pod labels, service accounts, and resource configurations—are inherited from your current Hydra
deployment. This minimizes potential configuration discrepancies and reduces the risk of errors.

:::

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

1. **Active Ory Hydra Deployment:** A production deployment is required because the migration job uses its configuration.
2. **Kubernetes Permissions:** Ensure you have sufficient privileges to create and apply Kubernetes jobs.
3. **Database Backup:** Always backup your database before attempting to revert any migrations.

## Deployment Process

### 1. Create a Job Values File

Create a file named `migrate-down-values.yaml` to define the job with the custom arguments for reverting the migration. Adjust the
parameters as needed:

```yaml
hydra:
  customMigrations:
    jobs:
      sql-migration-down:
        enabled: true
        customArgs: ["migrate", "sql", "down", "-e", "-y", "--steps", "1"]
```

If you need to revert all database changes introduced by the last migration, you must determine the number of applied statements
from the migration job. Check the migration job logs for a line similar to the following:

```
time=2025-03-05T11:47:18Z level=info msg=Successfully applied 2 migrations. audience=application service_name=Ory Hydra service_version=master
```

### 2. Prepare Helm resources

Pull the newest version of the Ory Helm chart and update the repository:

```
helm repo add ory https://k8s.ory.com/helm/charts
helm repo update
```

Locate the current production values file used by your Ory Hydra deployment. This file is needed to ensure that we revert the
correct migrations. Using your production values file ensures that the job is created with the same container image and
configuration as your production deployment.

### 3. Generate and Apply the Job Definition

This command produces a Kubernetes job definition that reverts the database migration using your production configuration with the
custom job arguments.

```
helm template hydra ory/hydra --namespace oasis --show-only templates/job-migrations-custom.yaml \
 -f hydra-values-used-by-your-production-env.yaml \
 -f hydra/oel/migrate-down-values.yaml > migrate-down-job.yaml
```

Verify the generated job definition in `migrate-down-job.yaml` to ensure that the custom arguments are correctly set. If
everything looks good, apply the job to your Kubernetes cluster:

```
kubectl apply -f migrate-down-job.yaml
```

## Possible issues

### Incorrect Migration Arguments

If the job fails, check that the custom arguments in migrate-down-values.yaml accurately reflect the intended migration reversal.
The default configuration reverts the last migration step, but you may need to adjust the --steps parameter if reverting more than
one migration is required.
