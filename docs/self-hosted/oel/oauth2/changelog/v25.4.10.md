## v25.4.10

### Remove the audience: audit field in some log entries

An experiment was made in the past to use logs for auditing, by having a certain field (i.e. key-value) present in the log entry,
e.g. in JSON: `"audience": "audit"`.

However, this approach was never used everywhere (only in some places in Hydra) and it was decided to stop the experiment.

As a result, the `"audience": "audit"` field is removed from these log entries. The rest of these log entries is unchanged.

Logs not using this field are unchanged.

Example before:

```
{"audience":"audit","level":"info","msg":"something happened","service_name":"Ory Hydra","service_version":"master","time":"2025-12-19T09:55:39.647379+01:00"}
```

Example after:

```
{"level":"info","msg":"something happened","service_name":"Ory Hydra","service_version":"master","time":"2025-12-19T09:55:39.647379+01:00"}
```

#### Breaking changes

None.

If you relied on the presence of this field in the logs, we recommend you use events or OpenTelemetry traces instead, which carry
much more information.

### Stricter URI validation for client metadata

Ory Hydra now enforces stricter validation rules for certain client metadata URIs when creating, updating or patching clients.
These fields include `policy_uri`, `tos_uri`, `client_uri`, and `logo_uri`. The URIs must now be valid URLs with either `http` or
`https` schemes. This change enhances security and ensures compliance with OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect specifications.
