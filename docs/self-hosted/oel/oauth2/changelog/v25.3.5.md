## v25.3.5

### Change of base image

The base image for OEL images is now set to "gcr.io/distroless/static-debian12:nonroot". Previously, it was
"gcr.io/distroless/static-debian12:debug-nonroot", which included BusyBox (a minimal shell and basic debugging utilities). Debug
images are still available using the "-debug" tag suffix.

### JWK Cache

Ory Hydra OEL now supports in-memory caching of JWKs to improve performance and reduce latency. The cache is enabled by setting
the `db.jwk_cache.enabled` configuration option to `true`. Other available configuration options are `db.jwk_cache.size`, which is
the maximum number of keys to be cached, and `db.jwk_cache.ttl`, which is the time-to-live for cached keys. It is recommended to
set a cache TTL to force regular refreshes of the keys. Updates to keys are not actively propagated to the cache, as clients are
expected to accept old keys for a certain period of time.
