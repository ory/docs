## v25.4.9

### Optionally Discard Skipped Consents

When enabled, the new `feature_flags.discard_skipped_consents` configuration option instructs Hydra to not store the full consent
(SQL table `hydra_oauth2_flow`). Instead, only an identifier is stored for a short period of time to prevent reuse attacks. It is
possible to skip consents for trusted OAuth2 clients per default by setting `skip_consent` to `true` for the trusted clients.
Otherwise, only consents that were already granted will be skipped.

#### Limitations

When this feature is enabled, OAuth2 client front- and back-channel logouts will not work anymore.

#### Example

```yaml
feature_flags:
  discard_skipped_consents: true
```
