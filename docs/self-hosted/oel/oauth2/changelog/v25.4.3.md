## v25.4.3

### Add feature flag to disable access token persistence for stateless JWT tokens

Introduces new feature flags `strategies.jwt.stateless.enabled` and `strategies.jwt.stateless.claim_name` for Hydra that skips
database writes for JWT access tokens. When enabled, access tokens are issued as self-contained JWTs with a top-level claim
indicating to be stateless, and operations that require token state (introspection, revocation, userinfo) return 501 Not
Implemented. This optimization significantly improves performance for workloads that use JWT access tokens and don't require token
revocation or introspection capabilities.

### Internal Bugfixes

This release includes some internal bugfixes that are required to ensure zero-downtime upgrades of future versions. Therefore, it
is highly recommended to not skip this version.
