### Fix regression in refresh token UsedTimes calculation

Fixed a regression in Hydra OAuth2 refresh token handling where the `UsedTimes` validation was incorrectly checking the `Valid`
flag before comparing against the graceful count limit. This caused refresh tokens to be incorrectly rejected during the grace
period when the `UsedTimes` field was not explicitly set, even when the usage count was within acceptable limits.

The fix ensures that refresh tokens are properly validated based on the usage count alone, without requiring the `UsedTimes` field
to be explicitly marked as valid in the database.
