### Optimized SQL migrations for PostgreSQL

We have improved SQL migrations for PostgreSQL in Ory Hydra when upgrading from Open Source release v2.2.0 or later. This change
reduces the need to acquire exclusive table locks, and removes some unnecessary other work. Exclusive table locks in PostgreSQL
block all writes to that table, thus stalling any in-flight requests.

### Automatic retries for serialization failures on PostgreSQL

Ory Hydra OEL now automatically retries transactions failing with serialization errors in PostgreSQL. In high-throughput
scenarios, this decreases the client error rate substantially in certain circumstances.
