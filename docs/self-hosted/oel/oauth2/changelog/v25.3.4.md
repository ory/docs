## v25.3.4

### Increased Refresh Token Grace Period

The maximum duration for the Refresh Token Rotation Grace Period has been extended from 30 days to 180 days in Ory Hydra with the
Ory Enterprise License (OEL). For Ory Network projects and non-OEL Hydra, the maximum grace period remains 5 minutes.

The extended 180-day period is only available when a reuse count (rotation_grace_reuse_count) is configured. Without a reuse
count, the limit remains 5 minutes.

Important: The 180-day grace period is considered insecure for general use. It is offered exclusively to support legacy migration
scenarios and is not recommended for production deployments.
