## v25.4.8

### Hard to revert SQL migration

This release includes an SQL migration for Ory Hydra that drops multiple constraints. Due to this, **reverting** the migration is
not very performant and may cause downtime. There should be no reason to revert this migration, as the schema itself is fully
backwards compatible. This version should not be skipped during an upgrade. If a version revert is necessary, we discourage
running the down migrations at all.
