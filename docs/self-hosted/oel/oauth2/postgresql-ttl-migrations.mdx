# PostgreSQL TTL jobs for Ory Hydra

This guide outlines the steps to enable and configure the PostgreSQL TTL jobs for Ory Hydra. The TTL jobs are executed
periodically to remove expired data from the PostgreSQL database. They are essential for maintaining database performance and
preventing uncontrolled growth.

This feature is available in Ory Hydra Enterprise License (OEL) and it requires the PostgreSQL database with the `pg_cron`
extension installed.

By default, Postgresql TTL jobs are disabled. They can be installed by enabling an additional migration job, similar to the
default migration job that introduces schema changes.

## Prerequisites

Before starting the upgrade process, ensure that you meet the following requirements:

1. **Ory Hydra Version**: Your current Ory Hydra OEL installation must be version ..TODO...
2. **PostgreSQL Database**: The PostgreSQL database must be installed and configured with the `pg_cron` extension.
3. **Backup and Testing**: Create a backup of your current Ory Hydra database and test the migration on a test environment to
   ensure compatibility and minimize risks.

## Installation process

If you are using the official [Hydra helm chart](https://github.com/ory/k8s/tree/master/helm/charts/hydra) modify your values.yaml
file to include the following configuration:

```yaml
hydra:
  customMigrations:
    jobs:
      oel-postgresql-ttl:
        enabled: true
```

This change enables the additional migration job that introduces the TTL jobs to the PostgreSQL database. By default, it executes
the `hydra` binary with following arguments:

```
migrate postgresql-addons up --hydra-db-name ory_hydra --pgcron-db-name postgres
```

If you use a different database name, you can override it by setting the `--hydra-db-name` and `--pgcron-db-name` flags in the
`values.yaml` file:

```yaml
hydra:
  customMigrations:
    jobs:
      oel-postgresql-ttl:
        enabled: true
        customArgs: ["migrate", "postgresql-addons", "up", "--hydra-db-name", "hydra", "--pgcron-db-name", "postgres_cron"]
```
