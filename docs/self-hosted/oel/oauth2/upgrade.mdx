title: Upgrading Ory Hydra OEL
---

This document provides a comprehensive guide on how to upgrade your Ory Hydra Enterprise License (OEL) version. Upgrading to the
latest version ensures you have the newest features, security updates, and performance improvements.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding with the upgrade, ensure you have:

- A valid Ory Enterprise License.
- Access to the Ory Enterprise Docker Registry.
- Backup of your current data and configuration.

## Pick the right version

To upgrade Ory Hydra OEL, you need to know the version you are currently running. Check your Docker or Kubernetes environment to
find the tag. You should find your tag in this list:

```mdx-code-block
import ImageTags from "../eol-image-tags.md"

<ImageTags />
```

:::note

Zero-downtime migrations are only possible if you do not skip any version when upgrading.

:::

The tags are ordered by date. To upgrade, you need to pick the next version in the list.

## Upgrade Using Helm Charts in Kubernetes

Upgrading Ory Hydra OEL in Kubernetes is straightforward when using Ory's Helm Charts. Follow these steps to upgrade Ory Hydra
OEL:

### 1. Enable auto SQL migration

Set `hydra.automigration.enabled` to `true` in the `values.yaml` file:

```
image:
  # ....
# ...
hydra:
  automigration:
    enabled: true
# ...
```

### 2. Update the image tag

```
image:
  repository: europe-docker.pkg.dev/ory-artifacts/ory-enterprise/hydra-oel
  tag: <replace-with-current-image-tag>
# ...
```

### 3. Apply / install the helm chart

You can now apply the upgrade:

```bash
helm upgrade ory-oel-hydra ory/hydra --namespace ory -f values.yaml
```

### 4. Wait for the upgrade to propagate

Once the init container is done and the main container is running, the upgrade is complete.

## Upgrade steps without Helm Charts

### 1. Check Release Notes

Before upgrading, review the [changelog](changelog.mdx) for the new version to understand the changes, new features, and any
deprecations.

### 2. Backup Your Data

Ensure you have a complete backup of your database and configuration files. This step is crucial for restoring your system in case
of an upgrade failure.

### 3. Pull the Latest Docker Image

Pull the latest Ory Hydra OEL Docker image from the Ory Enterprise Docker Registry:

```bash
docker pull europe-docker.pkg.dev/ory-artifacts/ory-enterprise/hydra-oel:<new-version-tag>
```

### 5. Apply SQL Migrations

Before deploying the service, you need to apply SQL migrations:

```bash
docker run \
  -e DSN=your_database_connection_string \
  europe-docker.pkg.dev/ory-artifacts/ory-enterprise/hydra-oel:<new-version-tag> \
  -- migrate sql up -e -f /path/to/config.yaml
```

Replace `your_database_connection_string` with your actual database connection string.

### 5. Start the Service

Now you will be able to start the service. In most environments, the release will gracefully rotate pods.

```bash
docker run \
  -p 4444:4444 -p 4445:4445 \
  -e DSN=your_database_connection_string \
  europe-docker.pkg.dev/ory-artifacts/ory-enterprise/hydra-oel:<new-version-tag> \
  -- serve all -f /path/to/config.yaml
```

Replace `your_database_connection_string` with your actual database connection string.
