## v25.3.5

### Change of base image

The base image for OEL images is now set to "gcr.io/distroless/static-debian12:nonroot". Previously, it was
"gcr.io/distroless/static-debian12:debug-nonroot", which included BusyBox (a minimal shell and basic debugging utilities). Debug
images are still available using the "-debug" tag suffix.
