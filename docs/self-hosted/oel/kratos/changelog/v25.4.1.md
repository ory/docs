## v25.4.1

### Session is now included in all settings hooks payloads

When configuring a settings flow hook in Ory Kratos, the session is now included in the payload sent to the hook. This allows for
better context and handling of user sessions during settings flows.

### Streamlined one-time code login flow

This update removes an entire step from passwordless and 2-factor login flows when a one-time code is the only available
authentication method.

Previously, users entered their identifier and then had to manually request a login code. With this change, the code is now sent
automatically as soon as the identifier is submitted.

By removing this extra step, the login experience becomes faster, simpler, and more intuitive for users who rely exclusively on
one-time codes.
