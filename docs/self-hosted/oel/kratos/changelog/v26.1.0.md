## v26.1.0

### Accept Hydra Login Challenge in Verification Flows

Fixes a bug where Kratos would not accept the Hydra login challenge in verification flows, if they originated from a refresh login
flow.

This would manifest as an "unknown form state" in Ory Elements and the Ory Account Experience.

### Change in Event Attributes

Login and Registration Events now include `SelfServiceMethodUsed` attribute. The `SelfServiceStrategyUsed` attribute is
deprecated, and it is advised to use newly introduced `SelfServiceFlowName` attribute.
