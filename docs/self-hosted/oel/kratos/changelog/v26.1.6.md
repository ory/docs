### Proper validation message for invalid email addresses and phone numbers

Kratos' APIs will now return more user-friendly validation messages when users provide invalid email addresses or phone numbers
during registration or profile updates.

#### Breaking changes

The message IDs for invalid email addresses and phone numbers have changed. Clients should update their localization files
accordingly:

- Invalid email address:
  - Old ID: `4000001` (with generic `"value" is not valid "email"` message)
  - New ID: `4000040` (with user-friendly "Enter a valid email address" message)
- Invalid phone number:
  - Old ID: `4000001` (with generic `"value" is not valid "phone"` message)
  - New ID: `4000041` (with user-friendly "Enter a valid phone number" message)
