### Properly accept OAuth2 login challenges in account linking flows

In the account linking flows, the OAuth2 login challenge was not properly accepted and stored in the login flow. This meant that
users going through account linking would not be redirected back to the OAuth2 client after logging in, but had to re-confirm
their credentials a second time. This has now been fixed by properly accepting and storing the OAuth2 login challenge in the login
flow.

### Properly fetch OAuth2 login challenge during code flows

During the one time code registration & login flows in Kratos, if the flow was initiated from Ory Hydra, the OAuth2 login
challenge was not properly fetched and returned in all API calls. This issue was resolved, ensuring that the OAuth2 login
challenge is now correctly retrieved and included in the responses during these flows.
