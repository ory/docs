## v26.1.2

### Properly accept OAuth2 login challenges in account linking flows

In the account linking flows, the OAuth2 login challenge was not properly accepted and stored in the login flow. This meant that
users going through account linking would not be redirected back to the OAuth2 client after logging in, but had to re-confirm
their credentials a second time. This has now been fixed by properly accepting and storing the OAuth2 login challenge in the login
flow.
