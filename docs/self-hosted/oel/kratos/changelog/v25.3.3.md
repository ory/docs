### FedCM Sign-In Now Triggers Login Hooks

We updated the Federated Credential Management (FedCM) sign-in flow to correctly trigger any "after login" hooks configured for
the OIDC (OpenID Connect) method.

This change ensures that when a returning user signs in using a FedCM provider, the system behaves consistently with other
OIDC-based logins.

This change adds distributed tracing and advanced metrics for the high-performance SQL connection pool in all Ory OEL products.
