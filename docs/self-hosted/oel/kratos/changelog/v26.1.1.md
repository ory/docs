### Fix `null` response in OAuth2 login flow with existing session

Fixed a bug where the `/self-service/login/browser` endpoint would return `null` instead of a proper error response when called
with an existing session, a Hydra login challenge, and `Accept: application/json` header.

### Requests to Admin Endpoint without `/admin` Prefix No Longer Redirect

The admin endpoint now serves requests that omit the `/admin` prefix instead of redirecting them with the correct path. This
change is not expected to affect existing clients, but instead avoids unnecessary redirects.
