## v26.1.13

### Add CAPTCHA support to recovery and verification flows

Extends CAPTCHA widget integration to include the self-service verification and recovery flows. This aligns security capabilities
with existing login and registration implementations.

### Add URL scheme validation for callback and redirect URLs

In Kratos' callback and redirect URLs (`...default_browser_return_url`), we now only allow for `http://` and `https://`, or empty
schemes.

### Passkey support for API flows

Kratos now supports passkey registration, login, and settings management through API flows. This enables passkey authentication in
mobile apps through native frameworks such as React Native, Swift, and Kotlin.
