## v25.4.0

### Session now available in settings after hook

When using the `After Hook` feature in Ory Kratos, the session is now accessible in the webhook's body context. This enhancement
allows developers to access session information directly within the after hook, enabling more dynamic and context-aware settings
webhooks.

### Significantly faster identity updates

This patch improves the performance of identity updates by optimizing database queries and reducing redundant operations. Users
will experience faster response times when signing up, updating their profiles, or changing credentials.
