## v25.3.9

### Make the ID of the recovery address of an identity optional when creating it

Before this fix, attempting to create, via the API, an identity with a recovery address which did not contain an ID, would fail
with an opaque error (`uuid: incorrect UUID length 0 in string ""`). Now, if the ID is not present at creation time, it will be
auto-generated.
