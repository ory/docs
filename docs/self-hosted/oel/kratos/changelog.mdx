### Support for External Identity IDs

Identity admins can now set an external_id field on an identity. If set, the external ID must be unique within the project. Admins
can retrieve an identity by external ID through the `/admin/identities/by/external/{id}` endpoint. In responses, the `external_id`
is contained in all identity and session responses. When tokenizing a session, the `external_id` is available in the Jsonnet
context. Optionally, admins can set the `subject_source` option on the tokenization config to `external_id`, in which case the sub
claim will be the external ID. Note that in this case tokenization fails if the external ID is not set for the identity bound to
that session.

### Make code submission attempt limit configurable

Previously the maximum number of submission attempts for codes (e.g., 2FA codes, email verification codes) was set to 5 in Ory
Kratos. This release allows the submission attempts to be configurable for system administrators based on specific security
policies or business requirements, the default value of 5 remains. To find out more how to configure it please read our
documentation https://www.ory.sh/docs/identities/sign-in/code-submission-limit
