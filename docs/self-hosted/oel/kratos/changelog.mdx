### Make code submission attempt limit configurable

Previously the maximum number of submission attempts for codes (e.g., 2FA codes, email verification codes) was set to 5 in Ory
Kratos. This release allows the submission attempts to be configurable for system administrators based on specific security
policies or business requirements, the default value of 5 remains. To find out more how to configure it please read our
documentation https://www.ory.sh/docs/identities/sign-in/code-submission-limit
