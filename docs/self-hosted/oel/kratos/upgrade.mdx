  repository: europe-docker.pkg.dev/ory-artifacts/ory-enterprise-kratos/kratos-oel
  tag: <replace-with-current-image-tag>
# ...
```

### Enable auto SQL migration

Set `kratos.automigration.enabled` to `true` in the `values.yaml` file:

```

  automigration:
    enabled: true
# ...
```

  europe-docker.pkg.dev/ory-artifacts/ory-enterprise-kratos/kratos-oel:<new-version-tag> \
  -- migrate sql up -e -f /path/to/config.yaml
```

Replace `your_database_connection_string` with your actual database connection string.

Now you will be able to start the service. In most environments, the release will gracefully rotate pods.

```bash
docker run \
  -p 4434:4434 -p 4433:4433 \
  -e DSN=your_database_connection_string \
  europe-docker.pkg.dev/ory-artifacts/ory-enterprise-kratos/kratos-oel:<new-version-tag> \
  -- serve all --config /path/to/config.yaml
