## v26.1.7

### Switched to better-sqlite3

We have replaced the unmaintained sqlite3 dependency with better-sqlite3 to ensure ongoing maintenance and stability.

`includeOidcTokensInAssertion` attribute. This allows downstream applications to access the original OIDC tokens issued by the
provider when using SAML federation.
