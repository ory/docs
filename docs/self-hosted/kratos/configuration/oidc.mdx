Follow these steps to add a generic provider as a social sign-in provider when self-hosting Ory Kratos.

1. Define the redirect URL:

   ```
   http(s)://<domain-of-ory-kratos>:<public-port>/self-service/methods/oidc/callback/<social-signin-provider-id>
   ```

1. Create a client at your generic provider to get a Client ID and Client Secret.
1. Set the redirect URI to URL that follows this pattern.
   `http(s)://<domain-of-ory-kratos>:<public-port>/self-service/methods/oidc/callback/<social-signin-provider-id>`.
1. Create a [Jsonnet code snippet](#data-mapping) to map the desired claims to the Ory Identity schema.
1. Encode the Jsonnet snippet with [Base64](https://www.base64encode.org/) or store it in a location available to your Ory Kratos
   instance.
1. Add the [social sign-in provider configuration](#configuration-with-ory-cli) to the Ory Kratos configuration. Add the Jsonnet
   snippet with mappings as a Base64 string or provide a path or an URL of the file.

## Environment variables

It is not recommended to use environment variables to configure OIDC providers, as the data object is complex and getting the
syntax right is difficult. If you want to use environment variables, it is recommended to set the full JSON array as an
environment variable:

```shell
export SELFSERVICE_METHODS_OIDC_CONFIG_PROVIDERS='[{"id":"google","provider":"google","mapper_url":"<file_location>","client_id":"<client_id>","client_secret":"<client_secret>","scope":["openid","email","profile"],"auth_url":"https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth","token_url":"https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v4/token","issuer_url":"https://accounts.google.com"}]'
```

## Prevent having to log in after sign-up

When adding social sign-in providers manually, remember to add the `session` hook to `after/oidc/hooks`. If you don't add this
hook, users will have to log in again after signing up to get a session.

```yaml
selfservice:
  flows:
    registration:
      after:
        oidc:
          hooks:
            - hook: session
```
