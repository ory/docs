Follow these steps to add a generic provider as a social sign-in provider when self-hosting Ory Kratos. First, you need to know
the redirect URL:

```
http(s)://<domain-of-ory-kratos>:<public-port>/self-service/methods/oidc/callback/<social-signin-provider-id>
```

Next,

1. create a client at your generic provider to get a Client ID and Client Secret;
2. set the redirect URI to URL that follows this pattern:
   `http(s)://<domain-of-ory-kratos>:<public-port>/self-service/methods/oidc/callback/<social-signin-provider-id>`;
3. create a [Jsonnet code snippet](#data-mapping) to map the desired claims to the Ory Identity schema;
4. encode the Jsonnet snippet with [Base64](https://www.base64encode.org/) or store it in a location available to your Ory Kratos
   instance;
5. add the [social sign-in provider configuration](#configuration-with-ory-cli) to the Ory Kratos configuration. Add the Jsonnet
   snippet with mappings as a Base64 string or provide a path or an URL of the file.

## Environment Variables

It is not recommended to use environment variables to configure OIDC providers, as the data object is complex and getting the
syntax right is difficult. If you want to use environment variables, it is recommended to set the full JSON array as an
environment variable:

```shell
export SELFSERVICE_METHODS_OIDC_CONFIG_PROVIDERS='[{"id":"google","provider":"google","mapper_url":"<file_location>","client_id":"<client_id>","client_secret":"<client_secret>","scope":["openid","email","profile"],"auth_url":"https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth","token_url":"https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v4/token","issuer_url":"https://accounts.google.com"}]'
```
