To enable or disable passwords, update your configuration file:

```yaml title="config.yml"
selfservice:
  methods:
    password:
      enabled: true
```

## BCrypt

Per default, passwords are hashed using BCrypt. You can configure the BCrypt hasher using the following options:

```yaml title="config.yml"
hashers:
  algorithm: bcrypt
```

:::danger

BCrypt has a maximum length of 72 bytes for passwords. If a longer password is attempted to be used, an error will be returned to
the user.

:::

Bcrypt algorithm can be configured only by the following `cost` option (default value is 12):

```yaml title="config.yml"
hashers:
  bcrypt:
    cost: 12
```

## Argon2id

By default, Ory Identities uses BCrypt algorithm for password hashing. Use the following option to use the Argon2id algorithm:

```yaml title="config.yml"
hashers:
  argon2:
    parallelism: 1
    memory: 128MB
    iterations: 3
    salt_length: 16
    key_length: 32
```

[setup guide](../../../kratos/guides/setting-up-password-hashing-parameters.md).
