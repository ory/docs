Use the Ory SDK to interact with **Ory Identities**, **Ory Permissions**, and **Ory OAuth2**.  
It works with Ory Network and when self-hosting Ory services.

Ory Oathkeeper has its own SDK. To learn more about it, visit the [Ory Oathkeeper SDK](./oathkeeper/sdk) documentation.

Before using the SDK, it is recommended to consult the [Ory REST API](./reference/api) documentation, which includes code samples
and examples for various programming languages.

[`hydra-client`](https://github.com/ory/sdk/tree/master/clients/hydra),
[`kratos-client`](https://github.com/ory/sdk/tree/master/clients/kratos), and
[`keto-client`](https://github.com/ory/sdk/tree/master/clients/keto) SDKs are no longer actively maintained.  
Read the [Ory SDK upgrade guide](https://www.ory.sh/docs/guides/upgrade/sdk-v1) to learn more.

:::

:::note backwards compatibility

The Ory SDK uses automated code generation by [`openapi-generator`](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator).
`openapi-generator` can make changes to the generated code with each new version, which breaks backwards compatibility in some
cases. As a result, the Ory SDK may not be compatible with previous versions.
