The Ory SDK allows for integration with Ory services, including **Ory Identities**, **Ory Permissions**, and **Ory OAuth2**.

Before using the SDK, consult the Ory [REST](./reference/api.mdx) API documentation, which includes code samples and examples for
various programming languages.

This SDK is intended to be used with Ory Network. For self-hosting Ory services use the respective client. Read more in the
[self-hosting documentation](./reference/reference-overview#servicespecific-sdks-for-selfhosted-deployments) for each service under **Reference/SDK**.

Ory publishes SDKs for popular languages in their respective package repositories:

### SDK Backwards compatibility

The Ory SDK uses automated code generation by [`openapi-generator`](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator).
`openapi-generator` can make changes to the generated code with each new version, which breaks backwards compatibility in some
cases. As a result, the Ory SDK may not be compatible with previous versions.
