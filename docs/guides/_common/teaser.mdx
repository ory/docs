  This guide shows how to create a simple {props.framework} application and secure access to the app with Ory. You can use this
  guide with both Ory Cloud and self-hosted Ory software.
</p>

This guide is perfect for you if:

<ol>
  <li>You have {props.framework} installed.</li>
  <li>You want to build an app using {props.framework}.</li>
  <li>You want to give access to your application to signed-in users only.</li>
</ol>

Before you start, watch this video to see the user flow you're going to implement:

<VideoEmbed mp4={props.mp4} webm={props.webm} />

You can find the code of the sample application [here](https://github.com/ory/docs/tree/master/code-examples/protect-page-login/).
