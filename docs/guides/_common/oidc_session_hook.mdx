When adding social sign-in providers manually, remember to add the `session` hook to `after/oidc/hooks`. If you don't add this
hook, users will have to login again after signing up to get a session.

```yaml
selfservice:
  flows:
    registration:
      after:
        oidc:
          hooks:
            - hook: session
```
