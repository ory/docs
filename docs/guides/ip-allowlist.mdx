To enhance your security measures while using the Ory Network, we've narrowed down the source IP addresses for all of our egress
traffic (webhook, emails etc.) to specific IPs.

These addresses will be used in the EU region:

- 34.22.170.75
- 35.242.228.133

These addresses will be used in the US region:

- 35.245.69.134
- 34.94.111.83

+These addresses will be used in the Asia region:

- 35.200.122.55

By setting your firewall rules to allow traffic only from these IP addresses, you'll be adding an extra layer of protection
against any unwarranted access attempts.
