title: Trigger custom logic and integrate with external systems with webhooks
sidebar_label: Ory Actions
---

Ory Actions supports webhooks, which are HTTP callbacks that can be triggered by specific events in your Ory-powered application.
Webhooks allow Ory Actions to notify external systems, such as Hubspot, Mailchimp, when certain events occur, such as a user
registration or profile update. Aside from integrating with external systems, webhooks allow you to use custom, external business
logic in Ory Actions.

Should you use webhooks? They work perfectly for use cases like these:

**Integration with third-party systems**

If you want to integrate your Ory Actions-powered application with another system, such as a CRM, an email marketing platform, or
an analytics tool, you can use webhooks to trigger updates in that system when events occur in your Ory Actions application.

**Automated workflows**

You can use webhooks to automate workflows and processes that span multiple systems. For example, you can use webhooks to
automatically add a new lead to your CRM when a user registers in your application.

**User data modification**

You can use webhooks to modify user data when certain events occur. For example, you can use webhooks to update user data in your
application when a user updates their profile information in another system.

**Passing additional data on registration**

When building your own UI you can pass additional data when completing the registration flow that gets forwarded to any configured
webhooks. This can be used to solve more complex use cases that would be out of scope for identity traits.

:::danger

Always put security first! When using webhooks, ensure that the data you send is secure and that the external system you are
integrating with is trustworthy. Additionally, make sure to consider the data privacy laws and regulations that may apply to your
use case.

## Creating Actions on the Ory Network

The Ory Network Console offers a simple and intuitive tool to manage your Actions.

Follow the steps below:

1. Navigate to <ConsoleLink route="project.developers.actions" />. There, click on **+ Create new Action**.
2. Choose the flow type that best suits your need and determine the execution time. Here, you should also provide other necessary
   data, such as the URL and request method.
3. Click on **Next**. The ensuing screen allows you to establish authentication parameters and input request body details. To
   learn more about tailoring your request body, see the relevant section below.
4. Once you have all adjusted settings, click on **Save action**. Your new Ory Action has now been created and is ready to
   operate.

## Configuration overview

Ory Action webhooks have several configuration options:

```yaml
hook: web_hook # To use webhooks, you must set 'hook' to 'web_hook'
config:
  url: https://test.hook.site.sh/before_login_hook # Webhook URL.
  method: POST # HTTP method used to send request to the webhook URL.
  body: base64://ENCODED_JSONNET # Encoded Jsonnet template used to render payload.
  response:
    ignore: false # Defines if the webhook response should be ignored and run async. Boolean. OPTIONAL
    parse: false # Defines if the webhook response should be parsed and interpreted. Boolean. OPTIONAL
  auth:
    type: # Can be one of 'basic_auth' or 'api_key'
    config: # Additional auth config for the hook. Read next section for details.
```

## Define HTTP request

Webhooks trigger HTTP requests to the webhook URL. You can configure the request method, URL, authorization, and body.

### Customizing request body with Jsonnet

Webhooks bind the `flow`, as well as request headers (`request_headers`), request method (`request_method`), and the request URL
(`request_url`) of the flow into the [Jsonnet](https://jsonnet.org) template for all methods and execution paths (before and
after). For the `after` execution path of all flows, it binds the `identity` and the `transient_payload` object into the Jsonnet
template as well. These objects are available through a `ctx` object.

#### Accessing request headers

The following request headers are available via `ctx.request_headers`:

```
Accept
Accept-Encoding
Accept-Language
Content-Length
Content-Type
Origin
Priority
Referer
Sec-Ch-Ua
Sec-Ch-Ua-Mobile
Sec-Ch-Ua-Platform
Sec-Fetch-Dest
Sec-Fetch-Mode
Sec-Fetch-Site
Sec-Fetch-User
True-Client-Ip
User-Agent
```

#### Jsonnet templating

To send `{ user_id: {some-id} }` in the request body, create the following the [Jsonnet](https://jsonnet.org) template:

```jsonnet
function(ctx) { user_id: ctx.identity.id }
```

Use the `ctx` object to access these fields in your Jsonnet template, for example:

```jsonnet title="./segment_identify.jsonnet"
function(ctx) {
  userId: ctx.identity.id,
  customData: ctx.flow.transient_payload.custom_data
  traits: {
    email: ctx.identity.traits.email,
    name: ctx.identity.traits.name,
    newsletterConsent: ctx.identity.traits.consent.newsletter,
  },
}
```

### Request authentication

Webhooks can be configured to use HTTP Basic Authentication or API Key authentication.

- API key authentication. Type must be set to `api_key`. All properties are mandatory.

  ```yaml
  hook: web_hook
  # other configuration keys
  config:
    auth:
      type: api_key
      config:
        name: Authorization
        value: { API Key value }
        in: header # alternatively "cookie"
  ```

- "Basic Authentication" type authentication. Type must be set to `basic_auth`. All properties are mandatory. For `basic_auth` the
  config looks as follows:

  ```yaml
  hook: web_hook
  # other configuration keys
  config:
    auth:
      type: basic_auth
      config:
        user: { USERNAME }
        password: { YOUR-PASSWORD }
  ```

### Canceling webhooks

You can cancel configured webhooks and not make the defined request.

This can come in handy in testing. For example, by canceling a webhook, you prevent the test accounts created during testing from
being added to CRM.

To get this behavior, cancel the webhook by raising an error for all accounts with the `test-` name prefix:

```jsonnet
function(ctx)
if std.startsWith(ctx.identity.traits.email, "test-") then
  error "cancel"
else
  {
    user_id: ctx.identity.id
  }
```

:::info

Jsonnet doesn't support regular expressions yet. Follow this issue to see if the feature has been implemented:
[google/go-jsonnet/409](https://github.com/google/go-jsonnet/issues/409).

:::

## Webhook response handling

Webhooks can be configured to ignore the response, or to parse the response and use it to interrupt the flow or to update the
identity.

### Non-blocking / async webhooks

Sometimes you need to interact with external systems without needing their response. For example, when a user signs up, a webhook
is that adds their email address to the newsletter is triggered.

If you decide that the system response that indicates if the process was successful is not critical for your setup, make the
webhook execution non-blocking to ignore whatever response is returned.

To do that, set `response.ignore` to `true` in the webhook config:

```yaml
hook: web_hook
config:
  # highlight-start
  response:
    ignore: true
  # highlight-end
```

### Modify identities

If you want the result of webhook execution to modify the identity, you can configure the webhook to parse the response:

```yaml
hook: web_hook
config:
  # highlight-start
  response:
    parse: true
  # highlight-end
```

When the webhook target returns a 200 OK response code and the response body is a JSON object with the key `identity` in it, the
values from that object will be used to change the identity before it is saved to the database. Modifying the identity is only
possible during registration and settings flows.

When updating any of the identity fields, be aware that the whole field is replaced by the value returned by the webhook. For
example, if the user signed up with

```json title="Identity before hook"
{
  "identity": {
    "traits": {
      "email": "joe@example.org"
    }
  }
}
```

and the webhook returns

```json title="Incorrect webhook response"
{
  "identity": {
    "traits": {
      "another_value": "example"
    }
  }
}
```

the identity will no longer have the `email` trait, which will break the sign up flow. Always make sure that the webhook returns
complete data:

```json title="Correct webhook response"
{
  "identity": {
    "traits": {
      "email": "joe@example.org",
      "another_value": "example"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Update identity traits

When the webhook target returns a 200 OK response code and the response body is a JSON object with the key `identity.traits` in
it, the values from that object will be used to replace the identity traits before they are saved to the database. This method
replaces the entire identity traits object. It isn't possible to update only a single trait.

```json
{
  "identity": {
    "traits": {
      "email": "0.g5vv0qpoxl@ory.com",
      "the_webhook": "updated this value"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Update identity metadata

When the webhook target returns a 200 OK response code and the response body is a JSON object with the key
`identity.metadata_public` or `identity.metadata_admin` in it, the values from that object will be used to replace the
[identity metadata](../kratos/manage-identities/10_managing-users-identities-metadata.mdx) fields before they are saved to the
database. This method replaces the entire metadata object. Partial updates to values in `metadata_public` or `metadata_admin`
aren't supported.

```json
{
  "identity": {
    "metadata_public": {
      "the_webhook": "changed this value",
      "and_added_this_one": "too"
    },
    "metadata_admin": {
      "the_webhook": "updated this value",
      "and_this_one": "too"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Update verification or recovery addresses

When the webhook target returns a 200 OK response code and the response body is a JSON object with the key
`identity.verifiable_addresses` in it, the values from that object will be used to replace the identity verification addresses
before they are saved to the database.

Verification and recovery addresses are taken from the `identity.traits` object using the Identity Schema. If you add additional
verification or recovery addresses, these will be deleted unless the identity traits also contain that address.

```json5
{
  identity: {
    traits: {
      email: "john@example.org",
    },
    // highlight-start
    verifiable_addresses: [
      {
        status: "completed",
        value: "john@example.org",
        verified: true,
        via: "email",
      },
    ],
    recovery_addresses: [
      {
        value: "john@example.org",
        via: "email",
      },
    ],
    // highlight-end
  },
}
```

#### Update the identity's external ID

When the webhook target returns a 200 OK response code and the response body is a JSON object with the key `identity.external_id`
in it, the value from that object will be used to replace the identity's external ID before it is saved to the database. This
method replaces the previous external ID, if any.

```json
{
  "identity": {
    // highlight-start
    "external_id": "external-id-from-webhook"
    // highlight-end
  }
}
```

### Flow-interrupting webhooks

If you want the result of webhook execution to have the potential of interrupting the flow, you can configure the webhook to parse
the response:

```yaml
hook: web_hook
config:
  # highlight-start
  response:
    parse: true
  # highlight-end
```

The external service called in the flow decides if it allows the flow to continue, or if it interrupts the flow. For example:

- For HTTP response codes `1xx`, `2xx`, and `3xx`, the flow is not interrupted.
- For HTTP response codes `4xx`, `5xx`, the external service interrupts the flow and returns a predefined payload.

Example payload:

```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "instance_ptr": "#/traits/foo/bar", // Points to the field that failed validation.
      "messages": [
        {
          "id": 123, // Unique numeric ID of the error that helps the frontend to interpret this message, doesn't have to be unique.
          "text": "field must be longer than 12 characters",
          "type": "error", // One of "error", "info", "success".
          "context": {
            // Contextual information about the error. Is schemaless, and can be used to provide additional information to the frontend.
            // Typically used to provide fields that are used in internationalization messages.
            "value": "short value",
            "any": "additional information"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

When using an `after` registration hook, you can define the specific point in the flow where this webhook is called:

- When the webhook parses the response, the logic is called before the system creates a new identity.
- When the webhook does not parse the response, the logic is called after the system creates a new identity.

You can call a webhook before and after the system creates an identity. To do that, define two webhooks with different `parse`
values:

```yaml
- hook: web_hook
  config:
    response:
      parse: true
- hook: web_hook
  config:
    response:
      parse: false
```

:::tip

Flow-interrupting webhooks work best if you give users meaningful information about the status of their flow. The best place to
trigger these hooks is `after` flows.

:::

### Webhook retries

Sometimes webhook delivery can fail due to issues such as network problems or server errors. To mitigate this, Ory Network
implements a retry policy that attempts to deliver the payload up to three times, with a 30-second timeout between each attempt.
This means that if delivery fails on the first attempt, Ory Network will automatically retry the delivery two more times, with a
30-second delay between each retry.
