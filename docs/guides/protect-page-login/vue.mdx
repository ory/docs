## Create Vue.js App

First, create a new Vue.js project. Run:

```shell-session
npx @vue/cli create ory-spa --preset "Default (Vue 3)"
cd ory-spa
```

## Install Ory SDK

Use `npm` to install the Ory SDK:

```shell-session
npm i --save @ory/client
```

## Check for Session in Component

With a Vue.js project created, add the Ory logic to the application. The application should recognize whether the user is signed
in and if they have a valid Session.

Depending on whether the user has a valid Session, the application should show registration and login links or account settings
and logout links.

To implement that behavior, modify the existing `HelloWorld.vue` component to include the appropriate logic:

```mdx-code-block
import handlerVue from '!!raw-loader!../../../code-examples/protect-page-login/vue/src/components/HelloWorld.vue'
import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock'

<CodeBlock language="html" title="src/components/HelloWorld.vue">{handlerVue}</CodeBlock>
```

## Run Ory APIs on `localhost`

The Ory security model uses HTTP cookies to manage sessions, tokens, and cookies. To do that, Ory APIs must be exposed on the same
domain as your application.

In the case of this example, the domain of your application, which runs on your local machine, is `localhost`.

:::info

When developing locally, use either `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`, but not both. Although technically these mean the same thing,
they're different hostnames.

Using both interchangeably in your code can cause problems with the origin of HTTP cookies sent by the application. When that
happens Ory APIs might not be able to read the cookies sent by your app.

:::

To get your application that runs locally and Ory APIs on the same domain, use Ory Tunnel - a development tool bundled with Ory
CLI. It's like a microservice - an authentication API server on your domain!

```shell-session
npx @ory/cli tunnel --dev http://localhost:8080
```

Ory APIs are now mirrored on `http://localhost:4000`. Use that URL as the `baseUrl` for the `@ory/client` SDK (see
`HelloWorld.vue` code above). The `--dev` flag disables security checks for easier integration and should not be used when
deploying the Tunnel to a staging environment.

## Run your Vue.js App

Now that your app is ready, it's time to run it!

First, set up your Ory Cloud SDK URL to connect with the Ory APIs in your Ory Cloud project:

```mdx-code-block
import SdkEnvVar from '@site/src/components/SdkEnvVar'

<SdkEnvVar />
```

Next, start the Next.js development server:

```shell-session
npm run serve
```

Go to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/) to access your application.

## Make Authenticated Calls to your API

To make authenticated requests to your API there are two main components:

- When making AJAX requests you must set `{"credentials": "include"}` in the options. For the `fetch` method it looks like this:

  ```js
  fetch(url, { credentials: "include" })
  ```

- Your API must have a CORS middleware with `credentials: true` and `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` of your frontend app (here
  `http://localhost:8080`).

Let's put this into action. Create a simple HTTP API with express. Run:

```shell-script
mkdir my-api
cd my-api
npm init
npm i --save @ory/client express cors
```

Next, create a simple API in `index.js`:

```mdx-code-block
import handlerApi from '!!raw-loader!../../../code-examples/auth-api/expressjs/index.js'

<CodeBlock language="js" title="index.js">{handlerApi}</CodeBlock>
```

Finally, start the server:

```shell-session
node index.js
```

### See it in Action

Access your single-page app at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/), sign in, and see if you can make authenticated requests
to your API!

## Go to Production

To promote this app to production:

1. Build the VueJS app and run it somewhere (for example on Vercel or Netlify)
2. Deploy the API (for example, on Heroku)
3. Connect your project with a [custom domain](../custom-domains.mdx)

These three components must be hosted on the same top-level domain as they were on your local machine:

| Component       | Production      | Local          |
| --------------- | --------------- | -------------- |
| Single Page App | www.example.org | localhost:8080 |
| API             | api.example.org | localhost:3000 |
| Ory             | ory.example.org | localhost:4000 |
