```mdx-code-block
import Teaser from '../_common/teaser.mdx'
import mp4 from '../_static/react/screencast.mp4'
import webm from '../_static/react/screencast.webm'

<Teaser
  framework={<a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>}
  mp4={mp4}
  webm={webm}
/>
```

## Create React App

First we create a new React project:

```shell-session
npx create-react-app --typescript my_project
cd my_project
```

## Install Ory SDK

Use `npm` to install the Ory SDK:

```shell-session
npm i --save @ory/client
```

## Require Login to Access the App Page

Next we add a session check to the default home page of the React example application.The highlighted code is what we added to
check whether the user is signed in, get the logout url flow and redirect them to the login page if not. There is also a welcome message with the registered user email and a logout link:

```mdx-code-block
import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock'
import App from '!!raw-loader!../../../code-examples/protect-page-login/react/src/App.tsx'

<CodeBlock language="tsx">{App}</CodeBlock>
```

## Run your React App

Great, that's it! Let's run your application! Set up your environment variables to connect with Ory's APIs

```mdx-code-block
import SdkEnvVar from '@site/src/components/SdkEnvVar'

<SdkEnvVar />
```

and start the React development server:

```shell-session
npm run start
```

To get your application that runs locally and Ory APIs on the same domain, use Ory Tunnel - a development tool bundled with Ory CLI.
It's like a microservice - an authentication API server on your domain!

```shell-session
npx @ory/cli tunnel --dev http://localhost:3000
```

Ory APIs are now mirrored on `http://localhost:4000`. Use that URL as the `baseUrl` for the `@ory/client` SDK (see code above).
The `--dev` flag disables security checks for easier integration and should not be used when deploying the Tunnel
to a staging environment.

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser. are presented with Ory's Sign In page! Let's click on
sign up and create your first user!

## Go to Production

To promote this app to production:

1. Build the React app and run it somewhere (for example on Vercel or Netlify)
2. Deploy the API (for example, on Heroku)
3. Connect your project with a [custom domain](../custom-domains.mdx)

These three components must be hosted on the same top-level domain as they were on your local machine:

| Component       | Production      | Local          |
| --------------- | --------------- | -------------- |
| Single Page App | www.example.org | localhost:3000 |
| Ory             | ory.example.org | localhost:4000 |
