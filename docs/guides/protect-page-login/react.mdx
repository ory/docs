```mdx-code-block
import Teaser from '../_common/teaser.mdx'
import mp4 from '../_static/react/screencast.mp4'
import webm from '../_static/react/screencast.webm'

<Teaser
  framework={<a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>}
  mp4={mp4}
  webm={webm}
/>
```

## Create React App

First we create a new React project:

```shell-session
npx create-react-app@latest --typescript
cd <your-project-directory>
```

## Install Ory SDK

Use `npm` to install the Ory SDK:

```shell-session
npm i --save @ory/client
```

## Require Login to Access the App Page

Next we add a session check to the default home page of the React example application.The highlighted code is what we added to
check whether the user is signed in, get the logout url flow and redirect them to the login page if not:

```mdx-code-block
import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock'
import App from '!!raw-loader!../../../code-examples/protect-page-login/react/src/App.tsx'

<CodeBlock language="tsx">{App}</CodeBlock>
```

## Run your React App

Great, that's it! Let's run your application! Set up your environment variables to connect with Ory's APIs

```mdx-code-block
import SdkEnvVar from '@site/src/components/SdkEnvVar'

<SdkEnvVar />
```

and start the React development server:

```shell-session
npm run start
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser. are presented with Ory's Sign In page! Let's click on
sign up and create your first user!

## Go to Production

To promote this app to production:

1. Build the React app and run it somewhere (for example on Vercel or Netlify)
2. Deploy the API (for example, on Heroku)
3. Connect your project with a [custom domain](../custom-domains.mdx)

These three components must be hosted on the same top-level domain as they were on your local machine:

| Component       | Production      | Local          |
| --------------- | --------------- | -------------- |
| Single Page App | www.example.org | localhost:8080 |
| API             | api.example.org | localhost:3000 |
| Ory             | ory.example.org | localhost:4000 |
