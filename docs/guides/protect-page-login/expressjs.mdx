```

## Create ExpressJS App

First we create a new ExpressJS project:

```shell-session
mkdir your-project
cd your-project

npx express-generator
npm i
```

## Install Ory SDK

To interact with Ory's APIs we install the Ory SDK:

```shell-session
npm i --save @ory/client
```

## Install Ory CLI

The last step is setting up the Ory CLI.

```
npm i --save @ory/cli
```

### Why do I Need the Ory CLI?

The Ory CLI includes useful functionality to manage your Ory Cloud Project. But
that'sn't why we require it in this guide!

Ory's philosophy is to make hard things easy for you. For this reason, Ory has
deployed measures against all
[OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) and implements the
[OWASP Authentication Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Authentication_Cheat_Sheet.html)
along other mechanisms.

Therefore, Ory manages Anti-CSRF Cookies as well as Ory Session Cookies for you.
That however requires that Ory and your application run on the same domain!

If your application runs on `http://localhost:3000` then Ory needs to be
available on the hostname `localhost` as well (for example
`http://localhost:3001`). That's why we need the Ory CLI, because it has a proxy
included which mirrors Ory's API endpoints on the domain of your application.

[![Ory Proxy mirrors Ory's APIs](https://mermaid.ink/img/pako:eNptkMFKxEAMhl8l5GIXdm1BT3MQWlxEEBxWL8JchjbaYqcZMlO0bPfdna71sGBOP-H7EpIj1twQKvwQ61t4OpgBUlVZJfwVSDaw293ND_tXaGP0Ks97rm3fcojqtiiKGXT2LBNo4e9p8-vqs-I6EZYANkJ-zTLlM5T6cYGvwpLCBf3vgpvzgjJ741Gg9H41ykU4UPA8BJr1OuaiWeEWHYmzXZNOOy6IwdiSI4MqxcbKp0EznBI3-sZG2jddZEH1bvtAW7Rj5JdpqFFFGekPuu9sepNbqdMP2FdlPQ)](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid-live-editor/edit#pako:eNptkMFKxEAMhl8l5GIXdm1BT3MQWlxEEBxWL8JchjbaYqcZMlO0bPfdna71sGBOP-H7EpIj1twQKvwQ61t4OpgBUlVZJfwVSDaw293ND_tXaGP0Ks97rm3fcojqtiiKGXT2LBNo4e9p8-vqs-I6EZYANkJ-zTLlM5T6cYGvwpLCBf3vgpvzgjJ741Gg9H41ykU4UPA8BJr1OuaiWeEWHYmzXZNOOy6IwdiSI4MqxcbKp0EznBI3-sZG2jddZEH1bvtAW7Rj5JdpqFFFGekPuu9sepNbqdMP2FdlPQ)

## Add NPM Run Script

Now that the Ory CLI is installed, let's add it as a `npm run` script to our
project:

```json title="package.json"  {7}
{
  "name": "protect-page-login",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "private": true,
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node ./bin/www",
    "proxy": "ory proxy --no-jwt --port 4000 http://localhost:3000/"
  },
  "dependencies": {
```

This requires the express app (`npm run start`) to run on port 3000. The browser
/ user uses however the port 4000
([http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)) to access the app.

## Require Login to Access the Home Page

Next we add a session check to the default home page of the example application.
The highlighted code is what we added to check whether the user is signed in,
and redirect them to the login page if not:

```mdx-code-block
import homePage from '!!raw-loader!../../../code-examples/protect-page-login/expressjs/routes/index.js'
import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock'

<CodeBlock language="js">{homePage}</CodeBlock>
```

## Run your ExpressJS App

Great, that's it! Let's run your application! Start the ExpressJS server

```shell-session
npm run start
```

and set up your environment variables to connect with Ory's APIs

```mdx-code-block
import SdkEnvVar from '@site/src/components/SdkEnvVar'

<SdkEnvVar />
```

Next open a new terminal window and start the Ory Proxy:

```shell-session
npm run proxy
```

To access the ExpressJS app through the ORY proxy open
[http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) in your browser. You are
presented with Ory's Sign In page! Let's click on sign up and create your first
user!

## Go to Production

```mdx-code-block
import ToProd from './_common/going-to-prod.mdx'

<ToProd />
```

```js {2,4-7}
var sdk = require('@ory/client')

var ory = new sdk.V0alpha2Api(
  new sdk.Configuration({
    baseUrl: 'https://ory.example.org',
    baseOptions: {
      // Ensures that cookies are included in CORS requests:
      withCredentials: true
    }
  })
)
```
