## Preface

From experience, we at Ory have noticed many resources do not fully explain
which authentication method is the correct method for that technology or use
case. With frameworks that support so many devices, it becomes difficult to
understand where to use, for example, session cookies, tokens, or even OAuth2
flows.

We won't cover such a wide range of topics in one guide and will thus split them
up into different projects/guides.

This guide will specifically focus on **Flutter Web using browser redirects to
set a session cookie**. To do this, we will rely on the Ory Managed UI for
login/registration instead of building our own.

## Create Flutter Web App

:::note

This guide assumes you already have flutter installed on your system. Please
follow the official installation guide if you have not at
https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install

:::

The below command will create a basic Flutter example application. We will just
add to it an authentication layer to keep the guide simple.

```shell-session
flutter create myapp
cd myapp
```

For HTTP requests we will use the [dio](https://github.com/flutterchina/dio)
package.

All the packages we use throughout this guide are listed in our `pubspec.yaml`.

```mdx-code-block title="pubspec.yaml"
import pubspec from '!!raw-loader!../../../code-examples/protect-page-login/flutter_web_redirect/pubspec.yaml'
import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock'

<CodeBlock language="yaml">{pubspec}</CodeBlock>
```

Package sources:

- https://github.com/flutterchina/dio
- https://github.com/java-james/flutter_dotenv

Next let us create an Authentication service in our `lib/services` directory,
which we will use to query the Ory APIs for session information.

```shell-session
touch lib/services/auth.dart
```

```mdx-code-block title="lib/services/auth.dart"
import auth from '!!raw-loader!../../../code-examples/protect-page-login/flutter_web_redirect/lib/services/auth.dart'

<CodeBlock language="dart">{auth}</CodeBlock>
```

Then we need to create an `.env` file in the root of our project to hold the
`ORY_BASE_URL` variable. This would be the Ory proxy URL (e.g.
http://localhost:3005/.ory) and the path to the Ory API `/api/kratos/public`.

```shell-session
touch .env
```

```mdx-code-block title=".env"
import env from '!!raw-loader!../../../code-examples/protect-page-login/flutter_web_redirect/env'

<CodeBlock language="text">{env}</CodeBlock>
```

Finally, we update the `main.dart` file to check for a session cookie on the
initial load of the application. This will determine if we redirect to the
sign-in/signup page or not.

```shell-session
touch lib/main.dart
```

```mdx-code-block title="lib/main.dart"
import main from '!!raw-loader!../../../code-examples/protect-page-login/flutter_web_redirect/lib/main.dart'

<CodeBlock language="dart">{main}</CodeBlock>
```

You can find the [full example application here](https://github.com/ory/docs/tree/d977f6a8616aa03ba7c77ce0588b0b89019807cf/code-examples/protect-page-login/flutter_web_redirect)

### Why do I Need the Ory CLI?

```mdx-code-block
import OryCLI from './_common/ory-cli.mdx'

<OryCLI />
```

## Run your Flutter Web App

```shell-session
flutter run -d web-server --web-port 4005
```

```mdx-code-block
import SdkEnvVar from '@site/src/components/SdkEnvVar'

<SdkEnvVar />
```

Start the Ory Cli proxy on [http://localhost:3005](http://localhost:3005) and
set the proxied application to [http://localhost:4005](http://localhost:4005).

```shell-session
ory proxy --port 3005 http://localhost:4005
```

Open the browser on [http://localhost:3005](http://localhost:3005) you should
now see the Ory managed Login page. Once you have completed the login/signup
flow you should be redirected back to your Flutter Web App with a session
cookie. The session cookie can now be sent to your server-side services to
validate the session on each API call.

:::note

This example only does a simple check on the initial load of the application and
is not meant to cover complex session checking in Flutter, nor how it would
interact with your Backend server.

:::

## Preparing for Production

Going to production with your app is possible in many ways. Whether you deploy
it on Kubernetes, AWS, a VM, or a RaspberryPi is up to you. To get your app
working with Ory, your app and Ory must be available under the same common
domain (e.g. `https://ory.example.com` and `https://www.example.com`).

The easiest way to connect Ory to your domain is to connect Ory to a subdomain
of yours. You can do this easily by
[adding a Custom Domain to your Cloud project](../custom-domains.mdx)!

With the custom domain set up, you do not need the Ory Proxy anymore and will
use the configured custom domain in your API calls:

```shell-session
export ORY_BASE_URL=https://ory.example.com
```

### Release Build

With the `flutter` cli we can build a release version of our App by running the
command below:

```shell-session
flutter build web
```

We then need an HTTP server to serve the files, we will use
[dhttpd](https://pub.dev/packages/dhttpd).

```shell-session
dhttpd --host localhost --port 4005 --path build/web
```
