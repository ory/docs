```

## Create PHP App

First we create a new PHP project:

```shell-session
mkdir your-project
cd your-project
touch index.php
```

## Install Dependencies

To interact with Ory's APIs we install the
[Ory SDK](https://packagist.org/packages/ory/client):

```shell-session
composer require ory/client:^v0.0.1-alpha
```

To simplify URLs handling we install the
[bramus/router](https://packagist.org/packages/bramus/router)

```shell-session
composer require bramus/router
```

To install Ory CLI follow
[this guide](https://www.ory.sh/docs/guides/ory-cli-install-use)

### Why do I Need the Ory CLI?

```mdx-code-block
import OryCLI from './_common/ory-cli.mdx'

<OryCLI />
```

## Create an Entry Page

This is a working example of basic `index.php` script which creates an Ory
client, registers new route for our Dashboard and makes use of
[Before Route Middlewares](https://github.com/bramus/router#before-router-middlewares)
to validate if the user is allowed to view the Dashboard.

```mdx-code-block title="index.php"
import indexPHP from '!!raw-loader!../../../code-examples/protect-page-login/php/index.php'
import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock'

<CodeBlock language="php">{indexPHP}</CodeBlock>
```

## Validate and Login

Next we will create handler which will check with your Ory project if the user
has a valid session. Notice here that we are taking the current `request`
cookies and passing them along to the Ory client.

If the session is not valid the request is redirected to the Ory project for
login. At this point we have not set up any custom UI management and thus will
be shown the Ory Managed UI login page.

For the last part we need to add the Dashboard handler (the page we would like
to protect) which will render an HTML with the session data.

This is accomplished by the simple `App` class stored in the `app.php` file:

```mdx-code-block title="app.php"
import appPHP from '!!raw-loader!../../../code-examples/protect-page-login/php/app.php'

<CodeBlock language="php">{appPHP}</CodeBlock>
```

## Run your App

Start your HTTP server and access the proxy URL

```shell-session
php -S 127.0.0.1:3000
```

```mdx-code-block
import SdkEnvVar from '@site/src/components/SdkEnvVar'

<SdkEnvVar />
```

```shell-session
ory proxy http://localhost:3000
```

To access the PHP app through the ORY proxy open
[http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) in your browser. You are
presented with Ory's Sign In page! Let's click on sign up and create your first
user!

## Go to Production

```mdx-code-block
import ToProd from './_common/going-to-prod.mdx'

<ToProd />
```

```php
$config = Ory\Client\Configuration::getDefaultConfiguration()->setHost("https://ory.example.org"));
$ory = new Ory\Client\Api\V0alpha2Api(new GuzzleHttp\Client(), $config);
```
