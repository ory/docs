<p>
  In this guide, we set up a new {props.framework} application and protect its
  home page with a login page using Ory. It will also add features such as
  profile settings, registration, and more. You can use this guide with both Ory
  Cloud and by self-hosting Ory software.

This guide is for you if you:

<ol>
  <li>
    have <a href={'https://nodejs.org/en/'}>NodeJS</a> installed;
  </li>
  <li>want to use {props.framework} to build an application;</li>
  <li>want to show your app only if the user is logged in.</li>
</ol>

Before we start, let's take a look at what user flow you will implement with
this guide.

<VideoEmbed mp4={props.mp4} webm={props.webm} />
