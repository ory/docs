## Create Golang App

First we create a new Golang project:

```shell-session
mkdir your-project
cd your-project

touch main.go handler.go middleware.go index.html
go mod init github.com/<your-name>/your-project
```

## Install the Ory SDK

To interact with Ory's APIs we install the Ory SDK:

```shell-session
go get -u github.com/ory/client-go
```

### Why do I Need the Ory CLI?

The Ory CLI includes useful functionality to manage your Ory Cloud Project. But
that is not why we require it in this guide!

Ory's philosophy is to make hard things easy for you. For this reason, Ory has
deployed measures against all
[OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) and implements the
[OWASP Authentication Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Authentication_Cheat_Sheet.html)
along other mechanisms.

Therefore, Ory manages Anti-CSRF Cookies as well as Ory Session Cookies for you.
That however requires that Ory and your application run on the same domain!

If your application runs on `http://localhost:3000` then Ory needs to be
available on the hostname `localhost` as well (e.g. `http://localhost:3001`).
That is why we need the Ory CLI, because it has a proxy included which mirrors
Ory's API endpoints on the domain of your application.

## Create an HTTP Server

This is a working example of a basic server which creates an Ory client,
registers a new route for our Dashboard and makes use of a middleware to
validate if the user is allowed to view the Dashboard.

```mdx-code-block title="main.go"
import mainGo from '!!raw-loader!../../../code-examples/protect-page-login/go/main.go'
import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock'

<CodeBlock language="go">{mainGo}</CodeBlock>
```

## Validate and Login

Next we will create a middleware which will check with your Ory project if the
user has a valid session. Notice here that we are taking the current `request`
cookies and passing them along to the Ory client.

If the session is not valid the request is redirected to the Ory project for
login. At this point we have not set up any custom UI management and thus will
be shown the Ory Managed UI login page.

```mdx-code-block title="middleware.go"
import middlewareGo from '!!raw-loader!../../../code-examples/protect-page-login/go/middleware.go'

<CodeBlock language="go">{middlewareGo}</CodeBlock>
```

## The protected page

For the last part we need to add the Dashboard (the page we would like to
protect). Add a new handler called `dashboardHandler` which will render an HTML
page with the session data.

```mdx-code-block title="handler.go"
import handlerGo from '!!raw-loader!../../../code-examples/protect-page-login/go/handler.go'

<CodeBlock language="go">{handlerGo}</CodeBlock>
```

## Run your Go App

Start your HTTP server and access the proxy URL

```shell-session
go run .
```

```mdx-code-block
import SdkEnvVar from '@site/src/components/SdkEnvVar'

<SdkEnvVar />
```

```shell-session
ory proxy http://localhost:3000
```

Then open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) in your browser. You
are presented with Ory's Sign In page! Let's click on sign up and create your
first user!

## Go to Production

Going to production with your app is possible in many ways. Whether you deploy
it on Kubernetes, AWS, a VM, or a RaspberryPi is up to you. To get your app
working with Ory, your app and Ory must be available under the same common
domain (e.g. `https://ory.example.com` and `https://www.example.com`).

The easiest way to connect Ory to your domain is to connect Ory to a subdomain
of yours. You can do this easily by
[adding a Custom Domain to your Cloud project](../custom-domains.mdx)!

With the custom domain set up, you do not need the Ory Proxy anymore and will
use the configured custom domain in your SDK calls:

```go
// register a new Ory client with the URL set to the Ory CLI Proxy
// we can also read the URL from the env or a config file
c := ory.NewConfiguration()
c.Servers = ory.ServerConfigurations{{URL: "https://ory.example.org"}}
```
