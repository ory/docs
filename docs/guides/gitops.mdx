This guide will walk you through the process of managing your Ory Network configuration in Git using GitHub Actions. By following
these steps, you'll be able to track changes, review, and approve them through pull requests, and automatically update the
configuration upon merge.

This guide uses the GitHub Actions to update the configuration and manage changes through pull requests. You can adapt this to
GitLab CI, TravisCI, CircleCI, and other CI/CD systems.

## Ory Network configuration

### Ory Identities configuration

First, pull the current configuration from your Ory Network project. You can also automate this with a GitHub Action, but in this
case, you just need it once. You can find the `workspace-id` and `project-id` in the Ory Network dashboard or by using
`ory list workspaces` and `ory list projects --workspace <workspace_id>`.

```bash
ory get identity-config --workspace "<workspace-id>" --project "<project-id>" --format json-pretty > identity-config.json
```

Commit the configuration to git and push it to your repository.

Now create a GitHub Action that will update the configuration when a pull request is merged.

Create a new file `.github/workflows/ory-cli.yml`. Add the following content to it:

```yaml
name: Update Ory Network Config

env:
  ORY_PROJECT_ID: "<project-id>"
  ORY_WORKSPACE_ID: "<workspace-id>"
  ORY_WORKSPACE_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ORY_WORKSPACE_API_KEY }}

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master
jobs:
  run-ory-cli:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container: oryd/ory:v1
    steps:
      - name: checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v6
      - name: Push changes to Ory Network
        run: ory update identity-config --file identity-config.json
```

For the GitHub Action to authenticate with Ory Network, you need to add the ORY_WORKSPACE_API_KEY secret to your repository. You
can configure secrets in the
[repository's settings](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions#creating-secrets-for-a-repository).

Now you can make changes to the configuration in git and create pull requests to review and approve the changes. When the pull
request is merged, the configuration will be updated automatically. You can also use this to roll back changes via the git
history.

### Ory OAuth2 & OpenID Connect configuration

The above approach works in the same way for other Ory Network configuration commands. For example, you can use the same approach
to manage the Ory OAuth2 & OpenID Connect configuration in git. First, pull the current configuration from your Ory Network
project:

```bash
ory get oauth2-config --workspace "<workspace-id>" --project "<project-id>" --format json-pretty > oauth2-config.json
```

Switch out the command in the GitHub Action:

```diff
-  ory update identity-config --file identity-config.json
+  ory update oauth2-config --file oauth2-config.json
```

### Ory Permissions configuration and Ory Permission Language

You can use the same approach to manage the Ory Permissions configuration in git. First, pull the current configuration from your
Ory Network project:

```bash
ory get permission-config --workspace "<workspace-id>" --project "<project-id>" --format json-pretty > permission-config.json
```

Add the update command for Ory Permissions configuration to the GitHub Action:

```bash
ory update permission-config --file permission-config.json
```

or for the Ory Permission Language configuration:

```bash
ory update opl --file permissions.ts
```

## OpenID Connect Claims and Ory Actions payload

Ory uses JSONNet snippets for mapping OIDC provider claims to Ory Network identities and for configuring the payload of Ory
Actions webhooks. You can save and version these snippets in git. You have several options for managing JSONNet snippets in git.
Here's an example of how you can organize them:

```bash
mkdir oidc-mapping
touch oidc-mapping/google.jsonnet
# add the mappings for OIDC providers you use
mkdir actions-payload
touch actions-payload/registration.jsonnet
# add the JSONNet payloads for Ory Actions you use
```

When you make changes, convert the new OIDC mapping or Ory Actions payload to base64 and add it to the config file. You can use
the following command to convert a file to base64 and copy it to the clipboard:

```bash
base64 < oidc-mapping/google.jsonnet | pbcopy
```

Now add the base64 encoded string to your configuration, this is how it looks with Ory Actions webhooks:

```json
//...
      "hooks": [
                {
                  "config": {
                    "body": "base64://PASTE_BASE64_STRING_HERE",
                    //...
                  }
                }
      ]
//...
```

This is how it looks with OIDC mappings:

```json
//...
      "oidc": {
        //...
            {
            //...
              "mapper_url": "base64://PASTE_BASE64_STRING_HERE",
            //...
            }
      },
//...
```

When you update the configuration, Ory Network will automatically decode the base64 string and save the JSONNet snippet in the Ory
Network backend.

## Identity Schema

It can also be useful to version the Identity Schema. This is the schema that's used to validate the identity data when new
identities are created. Most of the time this won't change, but if you use custom Identity Schemas it can help to keep track of
changes. You can copy the Identity Schema directly from the Ory Network console or get it from the config file you pulled earlier.

For example:

```json
//...
    // This is the default schema that's used for new identities
    "default_schema_id": "preset://email",
    // These are custom schemas that are available on your Ory Network project
    "schemas": [
      {
        "id": "7d1cf71e-57ae-40be-bddf-1f4c323e2349",
        "url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/bac-gcs-production/something.schema.json"
      },
    ],
//...
```

You can now save the default Identity Schema and custom Identity Schemas in git. When you make changes, convert the new Identity
Schema to base64 and update it in the config file. You can only update existing identity schemas, to create a new one use the Ory
Console. Use the following command to convert a file to base64 and copy it to the clipboard:

```bash
base64 < identity-schema.json | pbcopy
```

Now add the base64 encoded string to your configuration:

```json
//...
    "schemas": [
      {
        "id": "7d1cf71e-57ae-40be-bddf-1f4c323e2349",
        "url": "base64://PASTE_BASE64_STRING_HERE"
      },
    ],
//...
```

When you update the configuration, Ory Network will automatically decode the base64 string and save the updated Identity Schema in
the Ory Network backend.

## Email Templates

You can also version and track email templates in the same way. One option is to create a folder in your repository for email
templates and add the .html templates there. As with the other configurations you have to convert it into base64 and add it to the
config file, whenever you make changes to the template.

Read the [Custom email templates with Ory](https://www.ory.com/custom-email-templates) blog post to learn more about email
template configuration via the Ory CLI.
