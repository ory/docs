title: Requesting Second-Factor Authentication
---

When implementing MFA in your application, you might want to prompt signed-in users to provide their configured second factor.

To do that, initiate a new login flow using one of these endpoints with the `aal` parameter set to `aal2`:

- [`/self-service/login/browser`](../../reference/api.mdx#operation/initializeSelfServiceLoginFlowForBrowsers)
- [`/self-service/login/api`](../../reference/api.mdx#operation/initializeSelfServiceLoginFlowWithoutBrowser)

```shell
/self-service/login/browser?aal=aal2
/self-service/login/api?aal=aal2
```

When the user successfully provides their configured second factor:

- The method, for example `totp`, is added to the Ory Session.
- Ory Session Authenticator Assurance Level (AAL) is set to `aal2`.
- The `authenticated_at` time is set to the time when the user provides the second factor.

:::note

If the Ory Session has `aal2` already, this will error. In that case, you can request to refresh the session using the second
factor:

```shell
/self-service/login/browser?refresh=true&aal=aal2
/self-service/login/api?refresh=true&aal=aal2
```
