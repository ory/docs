---

You can enable Time-Based One-Time Password authentication in the Ory Identity Service (Kratos) to allow users to perform 2FA with
TOTP apps such as the Google Authenticator.

When enabled, users can pair a TOTP app with their account:

The example screenshot is captured using the Ory Managed UI.

When attempting to perform actions secured with 2FA, users get a TOTP code with the application identifier:

In this example, the user identifier (email - `alice@example.com`) is used. To learn how to enable this behavior, read
[this section](#distinguishing-identities-requesting-totp).

## Configuration

Follow these steps to enable Time-Based One-Time Password (TOTP) as the second authentication factor:

### Ory Cloud Console

1. Sign in to the **Ory Cloud Console** and go to **Two-Factor Authentication**.
2. In the **TOTP Authenticator App** section, use the switch to enable TOTP.
3. Define the name of the requesting party in the **Display Name**. The users sees this name in the TOTP application when getting
   a one-time password.
4. Click **Save** to finish.

### Ory CLI

1. Get the Identity Service configuration from your project and save it to a file:

```shell
## List all available projects
ory list projects

## Get config
ory get identity-config <project-id> --format yaml > identity-config.yaml
```

2. Find `totp` in `selfservice/methods`, set `enabled` to `true`, and define the `issuer`:

```yaml title="identity-config.yaml"
selfservice:
  methods:
    totp:
      // highlight-start
      config:
        # The "issuer" is the name in the TOTP application users see when getting a one-time password.
        issuer: ExampleIssuer.com
      enabled: true
      // highlight-end
```

3. Update the Ory Cloud Identity Service configuration using the file you worked with:

```shell
ory update identity-config <project-id> --file identity-config.yaml
```

### Self-Hosted Instances

When working with self-hosted instances of the Ory Identity Service (Kratos), add the `totp` method to `selfservice/methods` in
the configuration file:

```yaml title="kratos.config.yml"
selfservice:
  methods:
    totp:
      config:
        # The "issuer" is the name in the TOTP application users see when getting a one-time password.
        issuer: ExampleIssuerForSelfHosted.com
      enabled: true
```

### Distinguishing Identities Requesting TOTP

To help users distinguish which identity requests for the TOTP code, add a `totp` object to the trait which represents the TOTP
account name.

In this example, the user's email address is the identifier:

:::note

This configuration is the default for all Ory Cloud projects.

```json title="sample identity schema"
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "traits": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "email": {
          "type": "string",
          "format": "email",
          "title": "Your E-Mail",
          "minLength": 3,
          "ory.sh/kratos": {
            "credentials": {
              // ...
              // highlight-start
              "totp": {
                "account_name": true
              }
              // highlight-end
            }
            // ...
          }
        }
        // ...
      }
      // ...
    }
  }
}
```

## Writing E2E Tests

When writing end-to-end (E2E) tests for TOTP implementation in your app,
[you can reference the Cypress tests used in Ory Identity Service (Kratos)](https://github.com/ory/kratos/blob/fc2cecfbeab811aa1a851f953b6bc2a4c119c412/test/e2e/cypress/integration/profiles/mfa/totp.spec.ts).
