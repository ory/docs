title: Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication
---

You can enforce multi-factor authentication in one of two models:

- **Strict**, where secured operations always require the highest Authenticator Assurance Level (AAL).
- **Lax**, where the secured operations require only the `aal1` Authenticator Assurance Level (AAL).

You can set the required authentication model for these operations/endpoints:

- User sign-in (getting an Ory Session) / `/sessions/whoami` endpoint
- Self-service user settings

## Configuration

### Ory Cloud Console

In Ory Cloud projects, the default multi-factor authentication enforcement model is Strict.

To change it to Lax and allow users to sign in or access user settings without authenticating with the second factor, go to the
**Ory Cloud Console â†’ Two-Factor Authentication** and use the switches in the **General Settings** section.

### Ory CLI

Follow these steps to adjust the settings in Ory Cloud using the Ory CLI:

1. Get the Identity Service configuration from your project and save it to a file:

```shell
## List all available projects
ory list projects

## Get config
ory get identity-config <project-id> --format yaml > identity-config.yaml
```

2. Adjust the values of the indicated keys to the desired values:

```yaml title="identity-config.yaml"
# ...
selfservice:
  flows:
    settings:
      required_aal: aal1
# ...
session:
  whoami:
    required_aal: aal1
# ...
```

:::tip

Use `aal1` for the Lax model and `highest_available` for the Strict model.

:::

3. Update the Ory Cloud Identity Service configuration using the file you worked with:

```shell
ory update identity-config <project-id> --file identity-config.yaml
```

### Self-Hosted Instances

When working with self-hosted instances of the Ory Identity Service (Kratos), change the enforcement model by adjusting these keys
in the configuration file:

```yaml title="kratos.config.yml"
# ...
selfservice:
  flows:
    settings:
      required_aal: aal1
# ...
session:
  whoami:
    required_aal: highest_available
# ...
```
