title: Install the Ory CLI
---

Installing the Ory CLI on any system is straight forward. We provide prebuilt
binaries, Docker images, and support various package managers.

## Install via NPM

If you have a NodeJS project you can install the Ory CLI using:

```
npm i --save @ory/cli
```

## Install on macOS

You can install Ory CLI using [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) on macOS:

```shell
$ brew install ory/tap/cli
$ ory help
```

## Install on Linux

On linux, you can use `bash <(curl ...)` to fetch the latest stable binary
using:

```shell
$ bash <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ory/meta/master/install.sh) -b . ory
$ ./ory help
```

You may want to move the Ory CLI to your `$PATH`:

```shell
$ sudo mv ./ory /usr/local/bin/
$ ory help
```

## Install on Windows

You can install Ory CLI using [scoop](https://scoop.sh) on Windows:

```shell
> scoop bucket add ory https://github.com/ory/scoop.git
> scoop install ory
> ory help
```

## Download Binaries

The client and server binaries are downloadable at the
[releases tab](https://github.com/ory/cli/releases). There is currently no
installer available. You have to add the Cli binary to the PATH environment
variable yourself or put the binary in a location that is already in your
`$PATH` (e.g. `/usr/local/bin`).

Once installed, you should be able to run:

```shell
$ ory help
```

## Docker

You may also use Docker to run the CLI:

:::warning

Using the Ory CLI in Docker means that some of the tools, such as the Ory Proxy,
may not work!

:::

```shell
$ docker pull oryd/ory
$ docker run --rm -it oryd/ory help
```
