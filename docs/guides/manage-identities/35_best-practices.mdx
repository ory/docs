## Sensitive data in Identity schema

:::warning

The Identity schema isn't a place to store sensitive information that should not be visible to the end-user.

:::

The Identity Schema isn't the right place to store data that should be obfuscated from the user. Users can see traits and other
data - except credentials - using the `sessions/whoami` endpoint. Users are also able to edit identity traits. Visit
[this issue](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/47) for information on a feature that can be configured to prevent the end-user
from viewing/editing identity traits.

## Keep your data lean

Theoretically, any amount and type of data can be included in your Identity model. We recommend that you don't include more fields
than necessary in your Identity Schema. The Identity Schema should only include traits that are necessary or relevant to the
users' profile. If the data is related to something else - for example business logic - it makes sense to store it somewhere else.
It can still be captured in the sign up form, it just will need to be saved for example in your backend database.

## Updating Identity schemas

We strongly encourage everyone to specify unique (for example versioned) identifiers for every identity schema defined. This
allows you to gradually update your identity schema without affecting existing identities. Assume you just defined your first
Identity Schema:

```yaml
identity:
  default_schema_id: user_v0
  schemas:
    - id: user_v0
      url: file://path/to/user_v0.json
```

Weeks later you might notice that you want some additional fields, or want to break compatibility with your current schema. Just
add another version to the schema and change the `default_schema_id`:

```yaml
identity:
  default_schema_id: user_v1
  schemas:
    - id: user_v0
      url: file://path/to/user_v0.json
    - id: user_v1
      url: file://path/to/user_v1.json
```

All existing identities will continue to work as expected, having their identity schema ID be `user_v0`. All new identities will
user `user_v1`! If you are ready to do a migration, you can list all identities in your system with `user_v0` as the schema, and
update them to `user_v1` with the required data transformations using the REST APIs!

## Sanitize usernames/traits

To make sure usernames (or traits) satisfy a specific regex (for example only alphanumeric characters), they can be sanitized. To
sanitize usernames add
[Regular Expressions](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/string.html#regular-expressions) to the Ory
Kratos Identity Schema. To sanitize usernames coming from third-party OIDC providers like Google or GitHub write
[Jsonnet](https://jsonnet.org).
