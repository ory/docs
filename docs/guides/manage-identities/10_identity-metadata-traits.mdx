title: Identity metadata & traits
---

Identities have traits and metadata:

- **Traits** are the attributes of an identity, that can be updated by the identity owner, for example the username or email
  address.
- **Metadata** are the attributes defined by the system admin that can't be updated or modified by the identity owner. The only
  way to update the metadata is to use the `/admin/identities` APIs. These fields can be used to store, for example, the user's
  roles, subscription status, etc.

## Metadata

There are two types of identity metadata:

- **Public:** Attributes which can only be modified using the `/admin/identities` APIs. They are visible to the user when calling
  `toSession()` or `/sessions/whoami`.
- **Admin:** Attributes which can only be modified and read using the `/admin/identities` APIs. They are never directly exposed to
  the identity/user.

:::note

Metadata is not validated using the identity's JSON schema. You must ensure that the metadata you store is valid according to your
schema and you must keep the schema up to date to accommodate changes in the data.

:::

To manage metadata, use the following APIs:

- [`POST /admin/identities`](../../reference/api.mdx#operation/adminCreateIdentity)
- [`GET /admin/identities`](../../reference/api.mdx#operation/adminListIdentities)
- [`GET /admin/identities/{id}`](../../reference/api.mdx#operation/adminGetIdentity)
- [`PUT /admin/identities/{id}`](../../reference/api.mdx#operation/adminUpdateIdentity)

## Traits

Traits are the data associated with an identity. This data can be modified by the identity owner, for example at sign up or in the
profile update process. Identity traits can also be modified by users with Ory Identity Service (Kratos) Admin API access.

:::note

Ory Identity Service (Kratos) uses [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/learn/getting-started-step-by-step.html) to validate
Identity traits.

:::

Each identity can, theoretically, have a different JSON Schema. This can be useful in the following situations:

- There is more than one type of identity in the system for example: customers, support, staff.
- The system includes both human users and "robots" (sometimes also known as named service accounts).
- The system needs to ingest another company's Identity Schema.
- The system's Identity Schema changes or grows over time and requires versioning.

This example illustrates a usage scenario with three types of identities: regular customers,
[grandfather accounts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandfather_clause), and service accounts (for example a Microsoft
[Service Account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/access-control/service-accounts)). Each
identity has one JSON schema that defines it:

- Customers: `http://mydomain.com/schemas/v2/customer.schema.json`
- Grandfather Accounts: `http://mydomain.com/schemas/v1/customer.schema.json`
- Service Accounts: `http://mydomain.com/schemas/service-account.schema.json`

Ory Kratos expects the JSON Schemas in its configuration file:

```yaml
identity:
  # This will be the default JSON Schema. If `schema_id` is empty when creating an identity using the
  # Admin API or a user signs up using a selfservice flow, this schema will be used.
  #
  # This is a required configuration field!
  default_schema_id: person

  # Optionally define additional schemas here:
  schemas:
    # When creating an identity that uses this schema, `traits_schema_id: customer` are set for that identity.
    - id: customer
      url: http://foo.bar.com/customer.schema.json
    - id: person
      url: http://foo.bar.com/person.schema.json
```

Ory validates the identity traits against the corresponding schema on all "write" operations (create/update). The employed
business logic must be able to distinguish these three types of identities. You might use a switch statement like in the following
example:

```go
// This is an example program that can deal with all three types of identities
session, err := ory.SessionFromRequest(r)
// some error handling
switch (session.Identity.SchemaID) {
    case "customer":
        // ...
    case "employee":
        // ...
    case "default":
        fallthrough
    default:
        // ...
}
```
