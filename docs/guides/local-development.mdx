title: Local Development for Ory Cloud
---

As explained in the Ory Security Model description, Ory APIs must be available on the same domain as your application to allow
communication between the systems. When developing locally, your application is often exposed at the `localhost` domain.

The easiest way to achieve that is by using the [Ory Tunnel](cli/20_proxy-and-tunnel.mdx). Ory Tunnel is a tool that is a part of the
[Ory CLI](cli/01_installation.mdx).

Copy the Ory Cloud project slug from your project's [Connect page](https://console.ory.sh/projects/current/connect) and start the
Ory Tunnel:

```shell
ory tunnel --project <your-slug> --dev http://localhost:3000
```

Running this commands opens the `4000` port on your local machine. This address is connected to your Ory Cloud project and its
APIs. The value passed in the `--dev` flag must point to the host and port of the application you develop locally. In the example,
the application runs On `http://localhost:3000`.

:::tip

After starting the Tunnel, test it by performing the registration flow: `http://localhost:4000/ui/registration`.

:::

You can now start developing locally. Make sure to send any HTTP calls you make to `http://localhost:4000` and not
`https://<your-slug>.projects.oryapis.com`.

For example, when you configure the Ory SDK (here in NodeJS):

```javascript
import { Configuration, V0alpha2Api } from '@ory/client'

const sdk = new V0alpha2Api(
  new Configuration({
    basePath: 'http://localhost:4000', // instead of `https://<your-slug>.projects.oryapis.com`
    baseOptions: {
      withCredentials: true
    }
  })
)
```

## Limitations & Gotchas

Using the Ory Tunnel has a few limitations and gotchas.

### `localhost` vs `127.0.0.1`

Your local machine is usually available on both `localhost` and `127.0.0.1`. For the browser these two domains are different
top-level-domains. Cookies set on `localhost` will not be sent in requests to `127.0.0.1` and vice versa.

:::tip

If you encounter cookie issues, make sure that all of your requests are sent to `localhost` and not `127.0.0.1`.

### Social Sign-In

Currently, setting up [social sign-in](./social-signin/overview) on `localhost` isn't officially supported.

### WebAuthn

Currently, [WebAuthn](./mfa/webauthn-fido-yubikey) isn't officially supported on `localhost`. The reason for this is the explicit
origin matching in WebAuthn which is a measure against phishing.
