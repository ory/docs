title: Configure Projects with Ory CLI
---

All Ory components use the same configuration format and APIs when they are
self-hosted or consumed through Ory Cloud.

This allows you to use the Ory CLI to configure your components, no matter how
you use Ory!

:::note

Ory CLI is actively developed. This means that more configuration options are
added with new CLI releases.

:::

## Creating Projects

With Ory CLI, you can create a new Ory Cloud account and project from your
terminal.

To start, run this command to start the wizard:

```shell
ory auth
```

If you haven't signed in with the CLI before, you're asked if you have an Ory
Cloud account.

```shell
Do you already have an Ory Console account you wish to use? [y/n]: n
```

Answer "no" to create a new account. In the process, you must provide the basic
account information: email address, password, user name, and choose if you want
to be informed about platform security updates.

As a final step, accept the Terms of Service.

```shell
I accept the Terms of Service https://www.ory.sh/ptos:  [y/n]: y
```

When the process is completed, the CLI displays the created project and user
details:

```text
You are now signed in as: tom@email.com
ID			cae666dg-2ffa-491b-9912-6b090ec10e1c
EMAIL			tom@email.com
SELECTED_PROJECT	00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000000
```

## Using Existing Projects

To use the CLI with your existing Ory Cloud account and project, run this
command to sign in:

```shell
ory auth
```

Follow the on-screen instructions to sign in to your account. Upon successful
sign in, the CLI shows the details of the signed-in user and the selected Ory
Cloud project:

```text
You are now signed in as: john.wick@company.com
ID			7759555-e23a-44b7-b148-7fed7f908024
EMAIL			john.wick@company.com
SELECTED_PROJECT	00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
```

### Accounts with Social Sign-In

If you created your account through a social sign-in provider such as GitHub or Google, 
you must adjust your account configuration to use the Ory CLI. 

Accounts created with social sign-in providers don't use passwords. To sign in to your
account with the Ory CLI, you must provide your email address and password. 

Follow these steps to create a password for an account created with a social sign-in provider: 

1. Open the [Ory Console](https://console.ory.sh/) and sign in.
2. Go to your [account settings](https://console.ory.sh/settings).
3. Enter a new password in the **Update Password** field. 
4. Click **Save** to finish. 

## Configuring Projects

There are two ways to adjust the configuration of Ory Cloud projects. You can:

- overwite / import configuration from a file using the `ory update` command
- patch the existing configuration using the `ory patch` command

### Overwrite / Import Configuration

To overwrite the entire project configuration or to import a brand new config,
create a file with the configuration you want to use.

The configuration format follows the
[updateProject API request payload](../reference/api.mdx#operation/updateProject).

:::note

The `/services/identity/config` key is compatible with the
[Ory Kratos configuration format](../docs/kratos/reference/configuration.md)
except for some keys (for example `serve`, `dsn`) which will be ignored.

```json
{
  "services": {
    "identity": {
      "config": ...
    }
  }
}
```

:::

Let's look at an example. If you want to change the name of the email sender for
recovery and verification emails, create a configuration file that looks like
this:

```json title="config.json"
{
  "name": "My Project Name"
  "services": {
    "identity": {
      "config": {
        "courier": {
          "smtp": {
            "from_name": "My Custom E-Mail Name"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Next, use the Ory CLI to apply the config:

```shell
ory update project <your-project-id> --file config.json
```

### Patch Configuration

When you want to change specific parts of the configuration instead of
overwriting the entire config, use the `ory patch` command.

Use this command in combination with [JSON Patch](http://jsonpatch.com/) to
target individual keys.

To perform an update similar to the one described in the previous paragraph and
change the name of the email sender for recovery and verification emails, run
this command:

```
ory patch project <your-project-id> \
  --replace '/services/identity/config/courier/smtp/from_name="My Custom E-Mail Name"'
```

Use the `--replace` flag to indicate the key you want to change.

:::tip

Note that the part after `=` is interpreted as raw JSON:

- String: `/path/to/key="my string"`
- Bool: `/path/to/key=true`
- Number: `/path/to/key=123`
- Complex: `/path/to/key={"my": ["vaules", {"foo":"bar"}]}`
