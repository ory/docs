title: Configure Features using Ory CLI
---

All Ory components use the same configuration format and APIs when they are self-hosted or
consumed through Ory Cloud. 

This allows you to use the Ory CLI to configure your components, no matter how you use Ory!

:::note

Ory CLI is actively developed. This means that more configuration options are added with new CLI 
releases. 

:::

## Using the CLI with Ory Cloud

To use the CLI with your Ory Cloud project, run this command to sign in:

```shell
ory auth
```

Follow the on-screen instructions to sign in to your project. Upon successful sign in, the CLI 
shows the details of the user signed in to the Ory Cloud: 

```text
You are now signed in as: john.wick@company.com
ID			7759555-e23a-44b7-b148-7fed7f908024
EMAIL			john.wick@company.com
SELECTED_PROJECT	00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
```

:::tip

If you don't have an Ory Cloud project, you can create one straight from the CLI.

## Configuring Projects

There are two ways to adjust the configuration of Ory Cloud projects. You can:

- overwite / import configuration from a file using the `ory update` command
- patch the existing configuration using the `ory patch` command

### Overwrite / Import Configuration

To overwrite the entire project configuration or to import a brand new config, create a file with the configuration
you want to use. 

The configuration format follows the
[updateProject API request payload](../reference/api.mdx#operation/updateProject).

:::note

The `/services/identity/config` key is compatible with the
[Ory Kratos configuration format](../docs/kratos/reference/configuration.md)
except for some keys (for example `serve`, `dsn`) which will be ignored.

```json
{
  "services": {
    "identity": {
      "config": ...
    }
  }
}
```
:::

Let's look at an example. If you want to change the name of the email sender for recovery and verification emails, 
create a configuration file that looks like this: 

```json title="config.json"
{
  "name": "My Project Name"
  "services": {
    "identity": {
      "config": {
        "courier": {
          "smtp": {
            "from_name": "My Custom E-Mail Name"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Next, use the Ory CLI to apply the config:

```shell
ory update project <your-project-id> --file config.json
```

### Patch Configuration

When you want to change specific parts of the configuration instead of overwriting the entire
config, use the `ory patch` command.

Use this command in combination with [JSON Patch](http://jsonpatch.com/) to target individual keys.

To perform an update similar to the one described in the previous paragraph and change 
the name of the email sender for recovery and verification emails, run this command:

```
ory patch project <your-project-id> \
  --replace '/services/identity/config/courier/smtp/from_name="My Custom E-Mail Name"'
```

Use the `--replace` flag to indicate the key you want to change. 

:::tip

Note that the part after `=` is interpreted as raw JSON:

- String: `/path/to/key="my string"`
- Bool: `/path/to/key=true`
- Number: `/path/to/key=123`
- Complex: `/path/to/key={"my": ["vaules", {"foo":"bar"}]}`
