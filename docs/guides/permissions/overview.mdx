The Ory Permission Service ([Keto](https://github.com/ory/keto)) implements Google Zanzibar. It might differ a bit from
other authorization services you know, so let's first clarify a few concepts.

:::note Ory Cloud Availability

The Permission Service is available to all Ory Cloud users without additional fees or setup. The API is in a production-ready state. The documentation, integration, and UI are under active development.

:::

## Relations and Relation Tuples

The data model used by the Permission Service are so-called [relation tuples](/keto/concepts/relation-tuples.mdx) that encode relations between [subjects](/keto/concepts/subjects.mdx) and [objects](/keto/concepts/objects.mdx).

:::tip

Read the dedicated documents to learn more about [subjects](/keto/concepts/subjects.mdx) and [objects](/keto/concepts/objects.mdx).

:::

Examples of relation tuples are:

- `user1` is `member` of `groups:group1`
- `member` of `groups:group1` is `reader` of `files:file1`

As you can see, the subject of a relation tuple can either be a specific subject ID, or subjects defined through an [indirection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indirection)
(all members of a certain group). The object is referenced by its ID.

## Checking Permissions

Permissions are just another form of relations. Therefore, a permission check is a request to check whether a subject has a
certain relation to an object, possibly through one or more indirections.

As a very simple example, we assume the following tuples exist:

- `user1` is `member` of `groups:group1`
- `member` of `groups:group1` is `reader` of `files:file1`

Now, one could ask:

- Is `user1` a `reader` of `files:file1`? - Yes, because `user1` is a `member` of `groups:group1` and all `member`s of `groups:group1` are `reader` of `files:file1`.
- Is `user2` a `member` of `groups:group1`? - No.

## Example

This example setup demonstrates the basics of relation tuple management and usage of the Check API.

### Defining Namespaces

Relation tuples reside in [namespaces](/keto/concepts/namespaces.mdx). To create relation tuples, you must define their namespace first.

````mdx-code-block
import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock'
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="cloud" label="Ory CLI" default>

```shell
ory patch permission-config <your-project-id> \
  --add '/namespaces/-={"id": 0, "name": "resources"}' \
  --add '/namespaces/-={"id": 1, "name": "groups"}'
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="self-hosted" label="Self-Hosted Ory Keto Config" default>

```yaml title=path/to/keto.yml
namespaces:
  - id: 0
    name: resources
  - id: 1
    name: groups
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
````

### Creating Relation Tuples

After creating the namespaces, you can use the [relation tuple APIs](/reference/api.mdx#operation/createRelationTuple) to create a relation tuple.

````mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="cloud" label="Ory Cloud" default>

```shell
ORY_PAT="<your ory personal access token from the console>"
ORY_SDK_URL="<your ory project sdk url from the console>"

echo '[
  {
    "action": "insert",
    "relation_tuple": {
      "subject_id": "user1",
      "relation": "member",
      "namespace": "groups",
      "object": "group1"
    }
  }, {
    "action": "insert",
    "relation_tuple": {
      "subject_set": {
        "relation": "member",
        "namespace": "groups",
        "object": "group1"
      },
      "relation": "owner",
      "namespace": "resources",
      "object": "file1"
    }
  }
]' > relationtuple.json

curl -X PATCH \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ORY_PAT" \
  -d @relationtuple.json \
  "$ORY_SDK_URL/admin/relation-tuples"
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="self-hosted" label="Self-Hosted Ory Keto" default>

```shell
KETO_WRITE_URL="<your keto write url>"

echo '[
  {
    "action": "insert"
    "relation_tuple": {
      "subject_id": "user1",
      "relation": "member",
      "namespace": "groups",
      "object": "group1"
    }
  }, {
    "action": "insert"
    "relation_tuple": {
      "subject_set": {
        "relation": "member",
        "namespace": "groups",
        "object": "group1"
      },
      "relation": "owner",
      "namespace": "resources",
      "object": "file1"
    }
  }
]' > relationtuple.json

curl -X PUT \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @relationtuple.json \
  "$KETO_WRITE_URL/admin/relation-tuples"
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
````

### Checking Permissions

Permission checks are requests that check whether a subject has a relation to an object.
This relation can be directly defined, or constructed following indirections (e.g. members of a group).

The [Check API](/reference/api.mdx#operation/postCheck) allows to perform such checks:

````mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="cloud" label="Ory Cloud" default>

```shell
ORY_PAT="<your ory personal access token from the console>"
ORY_SDK_URL="<your ory project sdk url from the console>"

echo '{
  "subject_id": "user1",
  "relation": "owner",
  "namespace": "resources",
  "object": "file1"
}' > query.json

curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ORY_PAT" \
  -d @query.json \
  "$ORY_SDK_URL/relation-tuples/check"
# should print:
# {"allowed":true}
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="self-hosted" label="Self-Hosted Ory Keto" default>

```shell
KETO_WRITE_URL="<your keto write url>"

echo '{
  "subject_id": "user1",
  "relation": "owner",
  "namespace": "resources",
  "object": "file1"
}' > query.json

curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @query.json \
  "$KETO_WRITE_URL/relation-tuples/check"
# should print:
# {"allowed":true}
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
````
