title: JSON Web Token (JWT) Sessions
---

Sometimes the question comes up whether Ory supports issuing JSON Web Tokens as
Ory Sessions. We currently do not support this feature for several reasons:

1. Ory Sessions can end at any point in time, indicating that the user is no
   longer signed in. With JSON Web Tokens it would not easily be possible to
   determine whether a session is still valid before the JSON Web Token expires.
2. Ory Sessions can be updated and changed at any point in time (for example
   when the user updates their profile), which can not easily be reflected in a
   JSON Web Token before it is refreshed.

For these reasons, we do not support issuing JSON Web Tokens as Ory Sessions. We
are taking many steps to reduce the latency of `toSession` / `/sessions/whoami`
endpoints across the globe for Ory Cloud, so that latency is no longer an issue
for you.

If you are worried about making repeated calls to `toSession` /
`/sessions/whoami`, or want to use JSON Web Tokens, it is possible to convert
the Ory Session to a JSON Web Token on your entry point:

```mdx-code-block
import Mermaid from '@theme/Mermaid';

<Mermaid chart={`

	actor C as HTTP Client
    participant G as API Gateway
    participant O as Ory APIs
    participant S as API Server
    C->>+G:ory_session=...
    G->>+O:|GET /sessions/whoami
    O->>-G:id=... identity.id=...
    G->>G:Convert Session to JSON Web Token
    G->>+S:Authorization: Bearer jwt...
`}/>
```

An API Gateway capable of converting an Ory Session to a JSON Web Token is, for
example, [Ory Oathkeeper](https://www.ory.sh/oathkeeper).
