title: Overview

When an identity or end-user authenticates, for example by signing in with their username and password, they receive an Ory
Session.

The session is a proof that the user is authenticated and allows to interact with the system without the need to authenticate
again for every request.

Sessions can be issued in two formats:

- **Session cookie** - when the system detects that the interaction is done through a web browser, a cookie which represents the
  user's Session is stored in the browser.
- **Session token** - when the system detects a client other than a web browser, for example a native mobile app, a Session token
  is issued to the client.

:::note

For security reasons, you can't break the isolation between cookies and session tokens.

## The Ory Session

| `active`           | When set to `true`, the Ory Session is active and can be used to authenticate requests.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

## Session Cookie

The Session Cookie is issued when the user signs in through a web browser. To get the session payload, send a request to the
`/sessions/whoami` endpoint:

```mdx-code-block
import { getSdkUrl } from '@site/src/hooks'
import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock'

<CodeBlock language="shell">{`curl '${getSdkUrl().url}/sessions/whoami' \\
  -H 'Accept: application/json \\
  -H 'Cookie: ory_kratos_session=MTYzNDIyNzEzN3xEdi1CQkFFQ180SUFBUkFCRUFBQVJfLUNBQUVHYzNSeWFXNW5EQThBRFhObGMzTnBiMjVmZEc5clpXNEdjM1J5YVc1bkRDSUFJRTFDYWtvME5VNVlaVWxvYVZWeWJrUnZhSEF4YmxSV2VVRlhNMWwxVlVGenxXpsk2cL21Dclk3nCoXV41N6bFxvVJSt7CeICy_815Aw=='`}</CodeBlock>
```

## Session Token

A Session Token is issued when the user authenticates through a client other than a web browser. To get the session payload, send
a request to the `/sessions/whoami` endpoint.

You must pass the token in one of two ways:

- In the `Authorization` HTTP header:

  ```mdx-code-block
  <CodeBlock language="shell">{`curl '${getSdkUrl().url}/sessions/whoami' \\
    -H 'Accept: application/json \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer BRFbGMzTnBiMjVmZEcEdjM1J5YVc1bkRDSUFvME5VNVlaVeWJrUnZhSEF4YmxSV2VVRlhNMWwxVlVGenxXpsk2cLXV41N6bFxvVJSt7CeICy'`}</CodeBlock>
  ```

- In the `X-Session-Token` HTTP header:

  ```mdx-code-block
  <CodeBlock language="shell">{`curl '${getSdkUrl().url}/sessions/whoami' \\
    -H 'Accept: application/json \
    -H 'X-Session-Token: BRFbGMzTnBiMjVmZEcEdjM1J5YVc1bkRDSUFvME5VNVlaVeWJrUnZhSEF4YmxSV2VVRlhNMWwxVlVGenxXpsk2cLXV41N6bFxvVJSt7CeICy'`}</CodeBlock>
  ```

## Privileged Sessions

import { privilegedVideo } from '../../kratos/self-service/flows/code/settings'

To perform some pofile changes, such as updating the email address, password, or adding/removing 2FA, the user must have a
privileged session.

:::tip

This flow is similar to [GitHub's sudo mode](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/sudo-mode).

:::

The session is considered privileged when its `authenticated_at` isn't older than the `privileged_session_max_age` value defined
in the configuration.

This is how you update the `privileged_session_max_age` to `15m`:

````mdx-code-block
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="cloud" label="Ory CLI" default>

```shell
ory patch identity-config <your-project-id> \\
  --replace '/selfservice/flows/settings/privileged_session_max_age/lifespan="15m"' # 15 minutes
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="macos" label="Self-Hosted Ory Kratos Config" default>

```yaml title=path/to/kratos/config.yml
settings:
  after:
    hooks: []
    password:
      hooks: []
    profile:
      hooks: []
  lifespan: 30m0s
  // highlight-next-line
  privileged_session_max_age: 15m0s
  required_aal: highest_available
  ui_url: /ui/settings
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
````

With this configuration in place, the user can perform the actions that require a privileged session up to 15 minutes after
signing in. When this time passes, the user must re-authenticate to access these options.

Watch this video to see the flow in action:

<video controls width="100%">
  <source src={privilegedVideo.webm} type="video/webm" />
  <source src={privilegedVideo.mp4} type="video/mp4" />
  Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos.
</video>

## Refreshing Sessions

You can prompt the user to re-authenticate by interacting with the
[`/self-service/login/browser`](../../reference/api.mdx#operation/initializeSelfServiceLoginFlowForBrowsers) or
[`/self-service/login/api`](../../reference/api.mdx#operation/initializeSelfServiceLoginFlowWithoutBrowser) API and setting the
`refresh` parameter to true. Once the user has re-authenticated, the `authenticated_at` timestamp of the Ory Session will be set
to the current time.

```mdx-code-block
<CodeBlock language="shell">{`${getSdkUrl().url}/self-service/login/browser?refresh=true`}</CodeBlock>
```

If enabled, you can also refresh the second factor by setting both `refresh` and `aal`:

```mdx-code-block
<CodeBlock language="shell">{`${getSdkUrl().url}/self-service/login/browser?refresh=true&aal=aal2`}</CodeBlock>
```

## JSON Web Token (JWT) Support

:::warning

Ory doesn't issue Sessions as JSON Web Tokens (JWTs).

:::

Sessions are not issued as JWTs for two main reasons:

1. Ory Sessions can end at any point in time, indicating that the user is no longer signed in. With JWTs it would not easily be
   possible to determine whether a session is still valid before the token expires.
2. Ory Sessions can be updated and changed at any point in time (for example when the user updates their profile), which can't be
   easily reflected in a JWT before it is refreshed.

We are taking many steps to reduce the latency of `toSession` / `/sessions/whoami` endpoints across the globe for Ory Cloud, so
that latency is not an issue for users.

However, if you don't want to make repeated calls to `toSession` / `/sessions/whoami`, or you need to use JWTs in your setup, you
can convert Ory Sessions to JWTs on your entry point. There, you could add caching to further reduce the amount of API calls made.

:::tip

[Ory Oathkeeper](https://www.ory.sh/oathkeeper) is an API Gateway capable of converting Ory Sessions to JWTs.
