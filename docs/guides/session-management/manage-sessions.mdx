title: Manage Sessions

Two people can manage sessions:

1. The user who owns the session in **self-service**;
2. System administators using **administrative endpoints**;

## Self-Service Session Management

Using self-service session management, users can manage their own sessions.

## List Sessions using Self-Service

A user can list their own sessions using the `GET /sessions` API /
`listSessions` SDK command:

```mdx-code-block
import { getSdkUrl } from '@site/src/hooks'
import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock'

<CodeBlock>{`GET ${getSdkUrl().url}/sessions
Cookies: ory_kratos_session=...
# OR
X-Session-Token: ...`}</CodeBlock>
```

It returns a list of all sessions that are active and haven't expired, except
the current session. This can be used to show a UI with all other sessions that
are active.

:::note

Make sure to include the Ory Kratos Session Cookie when calling this endpoint.
If you are calling this endpoint from a proxy or middleware, make sure to
forward the cookies sent to the proxy/middleware. If you are calling this
endpoint as an AJAX call, make sure to include credentials and configure CORS
properly.

## Revoke Sessions using Self-Service

A user can revoke a specific session by calling the
[DELETE `/sessions/{id}`](../../reference/api.mdx#operation/revokeSessionById)
API / `revokeSessionById` SDK command:

```mdx-code-block
<CodeBlock>{`DELETE ${getSdkUrl().url}/sessions/{id}
Cookies: ory_kratos_session=...
# OR
X-Session-Token: ...`}</CodeBlock>
```

:::note

This endpoint can only be used for sessions other than the current session. For
revoking the current session, use the
[self-service logout](../../kratos/self-service/flows/user-logout.mdx).

:::

A user can also revoke all of their otther sessions using the
[DELETE `/sessions`](../../reference/api.mdx#operation/revokeSessions) API /
`revokeSessions` SDK command:

```mdx-code-block
<CodeBlock>{`DELETE ${getSdkUrl().url}/sessions
Cookies: ory_kratos_session=...
# OR
X-Session-Token: ...`}</CodeBlock>
```

This essentially logs the user out of all other sessions on any device. Sessions
that were revoked through self-service aren't deleted. Instead, they are marked
as inactive. Inactive sessions are retrievable and deletable through the
administrative API.

:::note

Make sure to include the Ory Kratos Session Cookie when calling this endpoint.
If you are calling this endpoint from a proxy or middleware, make sure to
forward the cookies sent to the proxy/middleware. If you are calling this
endpoint as an AJAX call, make sure to include credentials and configure CORS
properly.

## Administrative Session Management

As an administrator, you have access to all the sessions in the system.

### List Sessions as an Administrator

All sessions for a specific identity can be listed using the administrative
[GET `/admin/identities/{id}/sessions` endpoint](../../reference/api.mdx#operation/adminListIdentitySessions):

```mdx-code-block
<CodeBlock>{`GET ${getSdkUrl().url}/admin/identities/{id}/sessions
Authorization: Bearer {your-personal-access-token}`}</CodeBlock>
```

### Revoke Sessions as an Administrator

There is also the administrative
[DELETE `/admin/identities/{id}/sessions` endpoint](../../reference/api.mdx#operation/adminDeleteIdentitySessions)
to delete all sessions for a specific identity:

```mdx-code-block
<CodeBlock>{`DELETE ${getSdkUrl().url}/admin/identities/{id}/sessions
Authorization: Bearer {your-personal-access-token}`}</CodeBlock>
```

This forcefully logs the user out of all sessions, and also deletes all session
data.
