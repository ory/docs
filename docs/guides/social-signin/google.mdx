First off - you will need a Google Developer account. Go to
[Google Cloud Console](https://console.developers.google.com/) to create one.

Follow these steps to add Google as a social sign-in provider for your Ory Cloud
project.

1. Sign in to Ory Cloud Console and select
   [**Social Sign-in**](https://console.ory.sh/projects/current/social-signin).
2. Click the switch next to the Google logo to start the configuration.
3. Copy the Redirect URI.
4. Set up OAuth2 in [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
   Refer to [Google's guide](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158849) or
   follow these steps:
   - Select a project from the project dropdown, or create a new one.
   - If the APIs & services page isn't already open, open the console left side
     menu and select **APIs & services**.
   - On the left, click Credentials.
   - Click **Create Credentials**, then select OAuth client ID.
   - Set the application type and name your application.
   - Further down the form, click **Add URI** and paste the Redirect URI you
     copied from Ory Console.
   - Click **Create**.
5. Copy the Client ID and Client Secret to Ory Console.
6. Click **Save Configuration** to enable Google as a social sign-in provider.

:::note

The **Scopes** and **Data mapping** fields are optional - you don't have to
configure them to start using the social sign-in provider.

## Additional configuration

When adding a social sign-in provider, you can customize the integration by
defining the OAuth scopes Ory requests from the provider and by setting up
custom data mappings.

### Scopes

The Scopes section allows you to define the OAuth scopes Ory requests from the
sign-in provider. Defining scopes allows you to interact with the provider's
APIs on behalf of the user, or to access additional user data, which is exposed
as claims for data mapping.

Leave this field blank to use the default scopes.

To learn more about the scopes available for Google, read the
[related documentation](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/scopes).

### Data Mapping

The Data Mapping section allows you to map the data returned by the sign-in
provider to traits as defined in the identity schema. While optional, we highly
recommend you add it. The user experience will be worse if left blank, as a user
will have to supply their email address through an additional custom step after
completing the OAuth flow.

To define the mapping, create a Jsonnet code snippet. Read the
[OpenID Connect and OAuth2 Credentials](../../kratos/concepts/credentials/openid-connect-oidc-oauth2.mdx)
documentation for more details.

In this sample Jsonnet snippet, the user's `email`, `given_name` and
`family_name` properties as specified with Google, are mapped to the `email`,
`first_name` and `last_name` properties of an identity schema.

```google.jsonnet
local claims = {
  email_verified: true
} + std.extVar('claims');

{
  identity: {
    traits: {
      [if "email" in claims && claims.email_verified then "email" else null]: claims.email,
      first_name: claims.given_name,
      last_name: claims.family_name,
      // See note below for information about `hd`
      [if "hd" in claims && claims.email_verified then "hd" else null]: claims.hd,
    },
  },
}
```

`hd` is the hosted G Suite domain of the user, provided only if the user belongs
to a hosted domain. For a given email account with a custom domain
`example.com` - user1@example.com would produce `example.com` in the `hd` claim.

For more information on the ID payload returend by Google, have a look at
[their documentation](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/openid-connect#an-id-tokens-payload).
