## Configuration with Ory CLI

Follow these steps to add Apple as a social sign-in provider to your Ory Cloud project using the Ory CLI:

1. [Create an app, a service, and a private key using an Apple Developer account](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2019/06/04/what-the-heck-is-sign-in-with-apple#create-an-app-id).
2. In the created app, set the redirect URI to:

  ```shell
  https://<ory-cloud-project-slug>.projects.oryapis.com/self-service/methods/oidc/callback/apple
  ```

<a name="mapping"></a>

3. Create a Jsonnet code snippet to map the desired claims to the Ory Identity schema.

  ```json
  local claims = {
    email_verified: false,
  } + std.extVar('claims');

  {
    identity: {
      traits: {
        // Allowing unverified email addresses enables account
        // enumeration attacks,  if the value is used for
        // verification or as a password login identifier.
        //
        // Therefore we only return the email if it (a) exists and (b) is marked verified
        // by Apple.
        [if 'email' in claims && claims.email_verified then 'email' else null]: claims.email,
      },
    },
  }
  ```

```mdx-code-block
import JsonnetWarning from '../../_common/jsonnetwarning.mdx'

<JsonnetWarning format="Jsonnet code snippets" use="data mapping" />
```

4. Encode the Jsonnet snippet with [Base64](https://www.base64encode.org/) or host it under an URL accessible to Ory Cloud.
5. Download the Identity Service config from your Ory Cloud project and save it to a file:

  ```shell
  ## List all available projects
  ory list projects

  ## Get config
  ory get identity-config <project-id> --format yaml > identity-config.yaml
  ```

<a name="config"></a>

6. Add the social sign-in provider configuration to the downloaded config. Add the Jsonnet snippet with mappings as a Base64
string or provide an URL to the file.

  ```yaml
  selfservice:
    methods:
      oidc:
        config:
          providers:
          - id: apple # this is `<provider-id>` in the Authorization callback URL. It should be "apple"
            provider: apple
            client_id: .... # Replace this with the Services ID provided by Apple
            apple_team_id: .... # Replace this with the Team ID provided by Apple
            apple_private_key_id: .... # Replace this with the private key identifier generated by Apple
            apple_private_key: |
              -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
              .... # Replace this with the content of the private key downloaded from Apple
              -----END PRIVATE KEY-----
            mapper_url: 'base64://<YOUR_BASE64_ENCODED_JSONNET_HERE>'
            # Alternatively, use an URL:
            # mapper_url: https://storage.googleapis.com/abc-cde-prd/9cac9717f007808bf17f22ce7f4295c739604b183f05ac4afb4
            scope:
            - email
        enabled: true
  ```


7. Update the Ory Cloud Identity Service configuration using the file you worked with:

  ```shell
  ory update identity-config <project-id> --file updated_config.yaml
  ```

## Configuration for Self-hosted Instances

Follow these steps to add Google as a social sign-in provider when self-hosting Ory Kratos:

1. [Create an app, a service, and a private key using an Apple Developer account](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2019/06/04/what-the-heck-is-sign-in-with-apple#create-an-app-id).
2. Set the redirect URI to URL that follows this pattern:

  ```shell
  http(s)://<domain-of-ory-kratos>:<public-port>/self-service/methods/oidc/callback/apple
  ```

3. Create a [Jsonnet code snippet to map the desired claims to the Ory Identity schema](#mapping).
4. Encode the Jsonnet snippet with [Base64](https://www.base64encode.org/) or store it in a location available to your Ory Kratos
   instance.
5. Add the social [sign-in provider configuration to the Ory Kratos configuration](#config). Add the Jsonnet snippet with mappings
   as a Base64 string or provide a path or an URL of the file.

```mdx-code-block
import ConfigAsEnv from '../_common/config_as_env.mdx'

<ConfigAsEnv />
```

## Prevent Having to Login after Sign-Up

```mdx-code-block
import OidcSessionHook from '../_common/oidc_session_hook.mdx'

<OidcSessionHook />
```
