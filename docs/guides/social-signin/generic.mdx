A Generic Provider allows you to add social sign-in to your app with any
provider that is OpenID Connect Ceritified (such as
[Ory Hydra!](https://www.ory.sh/hydra)).

If the social sign-in provider you're looking for is not in our list of
preconfigured providers, chances are you can add them as a generic, give an
extra 2 fields of configuration.

Would you prefer to see your provider as a standard option?
[Let us know](https://share-eu1.hsforms.com/1-ARyzi8nSuCYQ9Ci2i18wgextgn)!

You will need the following values to set up a generic provider, keep them
handy:

- Client ID
- Client Secret
- Issuer URL - This is the OpenID Connect Server URL, the URL the provider
  issues tokens from.

To create a Generic Provider, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to Ory Cloud Console and select
   [**Social Sign-in**](https://console.ory.sh/projects/current/social-signin).
2. At the bottom of the page, click **Add A Generic Provider**
3. Copy the Redirect URI to the configuration of your chose Provider.
4. As a Provider Name, choose whichever label you prefer. This is used for
   display purposes only.
5. Add your Client ID, Client Secret and Issuer URL.
6. Click **Save Configuration**.

:::note

The **Scopes** and **Data mapping** fields are optional - you don't have to
configure them to start using the social sign-in provider.

## Additional configuration

When adding a generic social sign-in provider, you can customize the integration
by defining the OAuth scopes Ory requests from the provider and by setting up
custom data mappings.

### Scopes

The Scopes section allows you to define the OAuth scopes Ory requests from the
sign-in provider. Defining scopes allows you to interact with the provider's
APIs on behalf of the user, or to access additional user data, which is exposed
as claims for data mapping.

Leave this field blank to use the default scopes.

### Data Mapping

The Data Mapping section allows you to map the data returned by the sign-in
provider to traits as defined in the identity schema. While optional, we highly
recommend you add it. The user experience will be worse if left blank, as a user
will have to supply their email address through an additional custom step after
completing the OAuth flow.

To define the mapping, create a Jsonnet code snippet. Read the
[OpenID Connect and OAuth2 Credentials](../../kratos/concepts/credentials/openid-connect-oidc-oauth2.mdx)
documentation for more details.
