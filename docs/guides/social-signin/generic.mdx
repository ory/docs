The Generic Provider option allows you to add any OpenID Connect Certified provider that doesn't require custom API calls to get
the required user information.

[Ory Hydra](https://www.ory.sh/hydra) is such a provider.

To add a social sign-in provider, you need these details:

- Client ID
- Client Secret
- Issuer URL - OpenID Connect server URL used by the provider to issue tokens

## Configuration in Ory Cloud Console

To add a Generic Provider, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to Ory Cloud Console and select [**Social Sign-in**](https://console.ory.sh/projects/current/social-signin).
2. Click the **Add A Generic Provider** button.
3. Define the **Provider name**. This name is used for identification purposes only.
4. Paste the configuration details obtained from your social sign-in provider into the corresponding fields in the Console:
   - Client ID
   - Client Secret
   - Issuer URL
5. Copy the Redirect URI from the Console and add it to your provider's configuration.
6. Click **Save Configuration** to finish.

:::note

These steps cover the basic configuration of a social sign-in provider integration. At this point, the user experience is
incomplete. To complete the configuration and ensure a smooth and secure user experience, configure the [scopes](#scopes) and
[data mapping](#data-mapping) as described in the next section.

### Additional configuration

When adding a generic social sign-in provider, you can customize the integration by defining the OAuth scopes Ory requests from
the provider and by setting up custom data mappings.

#### Scopes

The Scopes section allows you to define the OAuth scopes Ory requests from the sign-in provider. Defining scopes allows you to
interact with the provider's APIs on behalf of the user, or to access additional user data, which is exposed as claims for data
mapping.

#### Data Mapping

The Data Mapping section allows you to map the data returned by the sign-in provider to traits as defined in the identity schema.

To define the mapping, create a Jsonnet code snippet. Read the
[OpenID Connect and OAuth2 Credentials](../../kratos/concepts/credentials/openid-connect-oidc-oauth2.mdx) documentation for more
details.

```mdx-code-block
import JsonnetWarning from '../../_common/jsonnetwarning.mdx'

<JsonnetWarning format="Jsonnet code snippets" use="data mapping" />
```
