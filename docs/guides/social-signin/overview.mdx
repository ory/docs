Thanks to social sign-in, users can use their existing accounts from providers such as 
Google, Slack, or Facebook for sign-up and sign-in in your application. 

Ory Cloud provides convenient, GUI-based flows for adding new social sign-in providers through the
Ory Console. Each flow is custom-tailored to accomodate configuration requirements of the specific 
identity provider.

This feature is being actively developed. New provider-specific flows are added to the Ory Console
with new releases.

By signing up with external identity providers, users give Ory access to the profile data 
of the account created in the external identity provider. This data is used to create an Ory 
identity and a user account in your application

Allowing users to use their existing accounts with your application removes the friction
that comes with having to remember another set of credentials and makes the decision to 
sign up much easier.

Adding social sign-in providers relies on OAuth2 authorization and the OpenID identity layer. 

## OIDC Token Handling

Ory Identity Service (Kratos) doesn't save the OIDC tokens it gets from social sign-in
providers. The tokens are exchanged for Ory Sessions. The tokens are used in the following way: 

1. Ory Identity Service starts the OIDC flow with a social sign-in provider.
2. Upon successful authentication, the social sign-in provider issues an `id_token`.
3. Ory Identity Service gets user information from the `id_token` claims.
4. The Identity service checks if a matching identity exists. <br />
    ✅ The user gets a Session. <br />
    ❌ Identity Service creates a new identity and issues a Session.
5. The system discards of the `id_token` when the flow is completed. 


## Preventing Account Linking

If you enable multiple registration methods users may be redirected to a social login provider 
to link their existing accounts after email verification. To disable this behavior, add the `session`
hook after one of the registration methods (for example `password`):

```yaml
selfservice:
  flows:
    registration:
      after:
        password:
          hooks:
            - hook: session
```
