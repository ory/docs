## Configuration in Ory Cloud Console

Follow these steps to add DingTalk as a social sign-in provider for your for your Ory Cloud project using the Ory Cloud Console.

1. Sign in to Ory Cloud Console and select [**Social Sign-in**](https://console.ory.sh/projects/current/social-signin).
2. Click the switch next to the DingTalk logo to start the configuration.
3. Copy the Redirect URI and save it for later use.
4. Create an OAuth2 app in DingTalk. Open a new browser tab, go to
   [App Development](https://open-dev.dingtalk.com/fe/app#/corp/app) and click **New OAuth App**.
5. Fill in required app details and click the **Register application** button.
6. Paste the Redirect URI copied from Ory into the **Authorization Callback URL** field in DingTalk.
7. Copy the Client ID and Client Secret of the registered application and paste it into the corresponding field in Ory Cloud Console.
8. Click **Save Configuration** to enable the social sign-in provider.

:::note

These steps cover the basic configuration of a social sign-in provider integration. At this point, the user experience is
incomplete. To complete the configuration and ensure a smooth and secure user experience, configure the [scopes](#scopes) and
[data mapping](#data-mapping) as described in the next section.

:::

### Additional configuration

When adding a social sign-in provider, you can customize the integration by defining the OAuth scopes Ory requests from the
provider and by setting up custom data mappings.

#### Scopes

The Scopes section allows you to define the OAuth scopes Ory requests from the sign-in provider. Defining scopes allows you to
interact with the provider's APIs on behalf of the user, or to access additional user data, which is exposed as claims for data
mapping.

For DingTalk, only support `openid` or `openid corpid`, add the `openid` scope for a basic setup.

To learn more about the scopes available for DingTalk, read the
[related documentation](https://open.dingtalk.com/document/orgapp-server/tutorial-obtaining-user-personal-information).

#### Data Mapping

The Data Mapping section allows you to map the data returned by the sign-in provider to traits as defined in the identity schema.

To define the mapping, create a Jsonnet code snippet. Read
[this document](../../kratos/concepts/credentials/openid-connect-oidc-oauth2#data-mapping-with-jsonnet) to learn more about data
mapping with Jsonnet.

:::info

DingTalk doesn't implement OpenID Connect. Because of this limitation, Ory Kratos makes a request to
[DingTalk's User API](https://open.dingtalk.com/document/orgapp-server/dingtalk-retrieve-user-information) and adds the user data to
`std.extVar('claims')`. Learn what data is available by reading the
[DingTalk's User API Documentation](https://open.dingtalk.com/document/orgapp-server/dingtalk-retrieve-user-information).

:::

In this sample Jsonnet snippet, `email` is mapped to the identity schema's `traits.email`:

```json
local claims = std.extVar('claims');
{
  identity: {
    traits: {
      // Allowing unverified email addresses enables account
      // enumeration attacks, especially if the value is used for
      // e.g. verification or as a password login identifier.
      //
      // Therefore we only return the email if it (a) exists by DingTalk.
      [if "email" in claims then "email" else null]: claims.email,
    },
  },
}
```

```mdx-code-block
import JsonnetWarning from '../../_common/jsonnetwarning.mdx'

<JsonnetWarning format="Jsonnet code snippets" use="data mapping" />
```

## Configuration using the Ory CLI

Follow these steps to add DingTalk as a social sign-in provider to your Ory Cloud project using the Ory CLI:

1. [Create a DingTalk OAuth app](#configuration-in-ory-cloud-console).
2. Create a [Jsonnet code snippet](#data-mapping) to map the desired claims to the Ory Identity schema.
3. Encode the Jsonnet snippet with [Base64](https://www.base64encode.org/) or host it under an URL accessible to Ory Cloud.
4. Download the Identity Service config from your Ory Cloud project and save it to a file:

```shell
## List all available projects
ory list projects

## Get config
ory get identity-config <project-id> --format yaml > identity-config.yaml
```

5. Add the social sign-in provider configuration to the downloaded config. Add the Jsonnet snippet with mappings as a Base64
   string or provide an URL to the file.

```yaml
selfservice:
methods:
  oidc:
    enabled: true
    config:
      providers:
        - id: dingtalk # this is `<provider-id>` in the Authorization callback URL. DO NOT CHANGE IT ONCE SET!
          provider: dingtalk
          client_id: .... # Replace this with the OAuth2 Client ID provided by DingTalk
          client_secret: .... # Replace this with the OAuth2 Client Secret provided by DingTalk
          mapper_url: 'base64://<YOUR_BASE64_ENCODED_JSONNET_HERE>'
          # Alternatively, use an URL:
          # mapper_url: https://storage.googleapis.com/abc-cde-prd/9cac9717f007808bf17f22ce7f4295c739604b183f05ac4afb4
          scope:
            - openid
```

6. Update the Ory Cloud Identity Service configuration using the file you worked with:

```shell
ory update identity-config <project-id> --file updated_config.yaml
```

## Configuration for Self-hosted Instances

Follow these steps to add DingTalk as a social sign-in provider when self-hosting Ory Kratos:

1. [Create a DingTalk OAuth app](#configuration-in-ory-cloud-console).
2. Set the redirect URI to URL that follows this pattern:

```shell
http(s)://<domain-of-ory-kratos>:<public-port>/self-service/methods/oidc/callback/<social-signin-provider-id>
```

3. Create a [Jsonnet code snippet](#data-mapping) to map the desired claims to the Ory Identity schema.
4. Encode the Jsonnet snippet with [Base64](https://www.base64encode.org/) or store it in a location available to your Ory Kratos
   instance.
5. Add the [social sign-in provider configuration](#configuration-with-ory-cli) to the Ory Kratos configuration. Add the Jsonnet
   snippet with mappings as a Base64 string or provide a path or an URL of the file.

```mdx-code-block
import ConfigAsEnv from '../_common/config_as_env.mdx'

<ConfigAsEnv />
```

## Prevent Having to Login after Sign-Up

```mdx-code-block
import OidcSessionHook from '../_common/oidc_session_hook.mdx'

<OidcSessionHook />
```
