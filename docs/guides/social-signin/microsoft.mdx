## Microsoft

This will enable you to log in using any Azure AD directory - Multi-tenant and
personal Microsoft accounts (for example Skype, Xbox) depending on the settings
made when creating the application in Azure AD.

#### Creating an Application in Azure AD

To set up "Sign in with Microsoft" you must first
[register an application with the Microsoft identity platform](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app).

Select "Web" as the "Redirect URI" type, and set the URI to:

```
http(s)://<domain-of-ory-kratos>:<public-port>//self-service/methods/oidc/callback/<provider-id>
```

After the "App Registration" is created, make note of the `Application ID` and
`Directory ID` on top of the Overview page. To create the client secret,
navigate to "Certificates & secrets" and click "+ New client secret". Remember
to copy the secret value as it will only be shown once.

#### Configuring Kratos

Create a Jsonnet claims mapper as described in

Save the code in
`<kratos-directory>/contrib/quickstart/kratos/email-password/oidc.microsoft.jsonnet`.

```json title="contrib/quickstart/kratos/email-password/oidc.microsoft.jsonnet"
local claims = std.extVar('claims');
{
  identity: {
    traits: {
      // Allowing unverified email addresses enables account
      // enumeration attacks,  if the value is used for
      // verification or as a password login identifier.
      //
      // If connecting only to your organization (one tenant), claims.email is safe to use if you haven't actively disabled e-mail verification during Sign-Up.
      //
      // The email might be empty if the account isn't linked to an email address.
      // For a human readable identifier, consider using the "preferred_username" claim.
      [if "email" in claims then "email" else null]: claims.email,
    },
  },
}
```

Enable the Microsoft provider in the Ory Kratos config located at
`<kratos-directory>/contrib/quickstart/kratos/email-password/kratos.yml`.

```yaml title="contrib/quickstart/kratos/email-password/kratos.yml"
selfservice:
  methods:
    oidc:
      enabled: true
      config:
        providers:
          - id: microsoft # this is `<provider-id>` in the Authorization callback URL. DO NOT CHANGE IT ONCE SET!
            provider: microsoft
            client_id: .... # Replace this with the Application ID from the App Registration
            client_secret: .... # Replace this with the generated Secret value from the App Registration
            microsoft_tenant: .... # Replace this with the Tenant of your choice (see below)
            subject_source: userinfo # or alternatively: me
            mapper_url: file:///etc/config/kratos/oidc.microsoft.jsonnet
            scope:
              - profile
              - email
```

Azure AD is now an option to log in to Ory Kratos.

```mdx-code-block
import ConfigAsEnv from '../_common/config_as_env.mdx'

<ConfigAsEnv />
```

##### Choosing Tenant

There are two ways to use the `microsoft` provider for authentication:

1. For authenticating users in a single Azure AD Directory (organization), set
   the `tenant` value to either the `Directory ID` from the "App Registration"
   page, or the organization domain.
   Examples:`8eaef023-2b34-4da1-9baa-8bc8c9d6a490` or `example.onmicrosoft.com`.
2. For authenticating any user in the Microsoft identity platform, set the
   `tenant` value to either:

- `organizations` to allow users with work or school accounts, or
- `consumers` to allow users with personal accounts, or
- `common` to allow both kind of accounts.

##### Choosing source of subject identifier

By default, the microsoft provider will rely on identifier taken from the `sub`
field of OIDC ID token. The same identifier is also returned by standard OIDC
`/userinfo` endpoint.

But there are systems out there that use `id` field returned by
`https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me` endpoint as a subject identifier. To make
migrating such systems to Kratos easier the microsoft provider allows using `me`
endpoint's `id` as an identifier. Set the provider config `subject_source` field
to `me` to activate this feature.

## Prevent Having to Login after Sign-Up

```mdx-code-block
import OidcSessionHook from '../_common/oidc_session_hook.mdx'

<OidcSessionHook />
```
