This page provides a high level overview of the rate limiting mechanisms employed by Ory to ensure system security and
availability. Rate limiting is important to protect your applications against abuse and attacks, prevent service disruptions, and
ensure fair usage for all our customers.

## Types of rate limits

Ory implements two main rate limits:

1. Project rate limits in Workspaces: These limits are determined by your Ory subscription plan and project environment. They
   define the maximum number of requests your projects can make to Ory's APIs within a given timeframe. This ensures fair resource
   allocation across all Ory projects.
   1. These limits are applied at the project level, meaning all requests from a specific project contribute to the rate limit
      counter for that project.
   2. Project rate limits are defined in terms of:
      - Burst limit: This governs the maximum number of requests allowed per second for temporary spikes in traffic.
      - Sustained limit: This sets the maximum request count over one minute, ensuring consistent and fair usage.
2. Endpoint based rate limits: These limits focus on safeguarding specific endpoints of your Ory projects against common attack
   vectors like brute-force and credential stuffing attempts. They typically consider factors like source IP address and request
   frequency to identify and mitigate malicious activity.
   1. Endpoint-based rate limits act as a first line of defense for your project endpoints. These limits often use the source IP
      address as a key criterion, allowing Ory to identify and block requests from suspicious or malicious sources.
   2. By analyzing request patterns and incorporating factors like source IP, Ory can effectively differentiate between legitimate
      user traffic and potentially harmful bot activity.

## Project rate limits in workspaces

With the introduction of Workspaces in Ory Network, rate limits are now applied to projects based on their assigned environment
and the Workspace's subscription plan. This approach ensures fair resource allocation and maintains the stability of the Ory
Network across different usage scenarios.

### How project rate limits work in workspaces

Rate limits for each project are determined by two main factors:

1. Workspace subscription: Your subscription plan (Developer, Production, Growth, or Enterprise) sets the baseline for your rate
   limits.
2. Project environment: Within each Workspace, projects can be assigned to Production, Staging, or Development environments, each
   with specific rate limit configurations.

For a detailed explanation of Workspaces and Environments, please refer to our
[Workspaces and Environments guide](/docs/guides/workspaces).

### Rate limit structure

Each rate limit policy includes two limits:

1. Burst limit: Maximum requests per second (rps), allowing for short traffic spikes.
2. Sustained limit: Maximum requests per minute (rpm), ensuring consistent performance over time.

### Determine your project's rate limits

To identify the rate limits that apply to your project:

1. Check your Workspace subscription plan (Developer, Production, Growth, or Enterprise).
2. Identify the environment (Production, Staging, or Development) assigned to your project.
3. Refer to the tables below based on your subscription plan and project environment.

### Rate limit tables by subscription plan

#### Developer plan rate limits

| Environment | Path / Bucket                     | Burst (rps) | Sustained (rpm) |

## Endpoint based rate limits

Endpoint based rate limits are controls applied to individual API endpoints within your Ory projects. Unlike project rate limits,
which govern overall project request volumes, endpoint based rate limits focus on safeguarding specific functionalities against
abuse.

### Purpose of endpoint-based rate limits

Ory implements endpoint-based rate limits to proactively secure individual endpoints and protect against common attack vectors
like brute-force and credential stuffing, while allowing for higher volumes of legitimate traffic from trusted sources. These
attacks typically involve numerous attempts to guess credentials or exploit vulnerabilities, often from a limited set of IP
addresses.

1. **Enhanced security:**
   - Restricts the number of requests from specific sources within a given timeframe.
   - Makes it significantly harder for attackers to succeed with brute-force or credential stuffing attacks.
   - Strengthens the security of your Ory projects and protects sensitive user data.

2. **Protection against malicious bots:**
   - Differentiates between genuine user traffic and potentially harmful bot activity.
   - Analyzes request patterns to identify and block automated malicious activities.

3. **Safeguarding specific endpoints:**
   - Offers granular control over how each endpoint handles traffic and responds to potential threats.
   - Allows fine-tuning of security measures for individual endpoints.
   - Optimizes protection without compromising the user experience.

4. **Fair usage:**
   - Complements project rate limits in ensuring fair resource allocation.
   - Contributes to a fairer and more stable platform for all users by mitigating abusive traffic.

5. **Flexibility for high-volume legitimate traffic:**
   - Provides options for Enterprise and Growth customers to whitelist internal IPs for higher rate limits.
   - Balances security needs with the requirements of high-volume legitimate traffic.

### Types of endpoint-based protection

These limits act as a first line of defense for your project endpoints. Ory implements multiple layers of endpoint-based
protection:

#### Traditional Rate Limiting

Analyzes incoming request patterns and considers factors such as:

- Source IP Address: Identifies and potentially blocks requests from suspicious sources or those exhibiting behavior indicative of
  malicious activity.
- Request Frequency: Monitors how often requests are made to a specific endpoint to detect and thwart attempts to overwhelm the
  system or exploit vulnerabilities.
- User Authentication: (If applicable) Considers whether requests are authenticated and may apply different limits for
  authenticated vs. unauthenticated requests.
- Request Method: May apply different limits based on the HTTP method used (GET, POST, etc.).
- IP Whitelist Status: Applies higher limits to whitelisted IPs for Enterprise and Growth customers.

#### Inflight Request Limiting

We limit inflight requests to protect important admin resources from problems caused by multiple requests happening at the same
time. This prevents data conflicts and keeps your system stable. Our inflight limiting protects critical Kratos endpoints from
concurrent request attacks. It prevents race conditions and keeps your data consistent. Admin operations complete safely without
interference from other requests.

:::note

These limits mainly protect against write requests to the same resource happening in parallel—usually caused by implementation
issues. :::

### Protected endpoints

The following endpoints are protected by different types of rate limiting:

| Type        | Endpoint                                    | HTTP Methods             | Ratelimit Key                                    | Action                                 |
| :---------- | :------------------------------------------ | :----------------------- | :----------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------- |
| Brute-force |                                             |                          |                                                  | To be added later                      |
| Inflight    | `/admin/identities`                         | `POST`, `PATCH`          | `{project_id} + {full_path}`                     | Blocks concurrent requests (enforced)  |
| Inflight    | `/admin/identities/{id}`                    | `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE` | `{project_id} + {full_path}`                     | Blocks concurrent requests (enforced)  |
| Inflight    | `/admin/identities/{id}/credentials/{type}` | `DELETE`                 | `{project_id} + {full_path}`                     | Blocks concurrent requests (enforced)  |
| Inflight    | `/admin/identities/{id}/sessions`           | `DELETE`                 | `{project_id} + {full_path}`                     | Blocks concurrent requests (enforced)  |
| Inflight    | `/admin/sessions/{id}`                      | `DELETE`                 | `{project_id} + {full_path}`                     | Logs concurrent requests (report-only) |
| Inflight    | `/admin/sessions/{id}/extend`               | `PATCH`                  | `{project_id} + {full_path}`                     | Logs concurrent requests (report-only) |
| Inflight    | `/self-service/recovery`                    | `POST`                   | `{project_id} + {path} + "/" + {email\|flow_id}` | Logs concurrent requests (report-only) |

**Note**: Report-only endpoints are observed over a period of time before enforcement is enabled. They currently log rate limit
violations for monitoring purposes but do not block requests, while enforced endpoints return HTTP 429 when rate limits are
exceeded. GET, OPTIONS, and HEAD requests are exempt from rate limiting.

### Configuration and management

#### Rule management

The endpoint-based rate limit rules are set and managed by Ory. These rules are not directly configurable by Enterprise and Growth
customers yet.

#### IP Whitelisting for Enterprise and Growth plans

Enterprise and Growth plans can whitelist internal IPs. This feature is designed for cases where these IPs generate high volumes
of legitimate calls that might otherwise trigger rate-limit rules.

- Whitelisted IPs are subject to the same rule structure but with higher limits.
- To whitelist IPs, please create a support ticket with Ory: <ConsoleLink route="support" /> .
- This feature ensures that high volume traffic from trusted sources is not interrupted while maintaining strong security
  measures.
