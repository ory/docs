title: Configure Ory Permissions
---

Using the Ory CLI, you can quickly adjust the configuration of Ory Permissions and apply config from the Ory Network environment
to self-hosted Ory Keto instances.

:::tip

Ory Keto is the open-source project that powers Ory Permissions.

:::

This feature is useful for fluently moving your local setup to The Ory Network, or for working on the configuration and testing
different settings in the safety of the local development environment.

To work with the Ory Permissions, you must have an active project. Use the [CLI](./config-with-cli#create-ory-cloud-project) or
the [Ory Console](https://console.ory.sh/) to create one.

## Export configuration from The Ory Network

To get your project's Ory Permissions configuration, run this command:

:::info

You must be signed in to an Ory Network account to perform this action. Read
[this document](./cli-basics#use-cli-with-existing-cloud-account) to learn more.

:::

```bash
## List all available projects
ory list projects

## Get config
ory get permission-config <project-id> --format yaml
```

The `--format` flag defines the format of the output file. You can choose one of `yaml` ,`json`, or `json-pretty`.

Getting the configuration in the YAML format produces output that is ready to use with self-hosted Ory Keto.

### Export to file

For a convenient way to get the Ory Permissions configuration working in self-hosted Ory Keto, save the configuration to a YAML
file.

Run this command:

```bash
ory get permission-config <project-id> --format yaml > permission-config.yaml
```

## Import configuration to The Ory Network

To start using the configuration from a self-hosted Ory Keto instance in the Ory Permissions, import the configuration file with
the CLI:

```shell
ory update permission-config <project-id> --file permission-config.yaml
```

## Adjust specific keys

You can adjust specific keys in the configuration using the `ory patch` CLI command.

Running this sample command sets the `/limit/max_read_depth` key value to `3`:

```shell
ory patch permission-config <project-id> \
  --replace '/limit/max_read_depth=3'
```

:::note

Read [this document](./config-with-cli) to learn more about adjusting project configuration with the Ory CLI.

## Manage relation tuples

You can manage [relation tuples](../../keto/concepts/relation-tuples) using Ory CLI. To run these operations, you must provide the
ID of the project in which you want to manage the tuples using the `--project` flag.

For convenience, you can export the ID of your project as an environment variable and use the variable with the `--project` flag
instead of passing the project ID directly in the command:

:::info

Examples in this section use the environment variable. To try them out without making adjustments, export your project ID as an
environment variable.

:::

```bash
## List all available projects
ory list projects

## Export project ID as env. variable
export PROJECT=<ory-project-id>
```

### Create

Read the [Ory CLI reference](../../cli/ory-create-relation-tuples) to learn more about this command.

```bash
echo "groups:devs#member@tom" \
  | ory parse relation-tuples --project=$PROJECT --format=json \
  | ory create relation-tuples --project=$PROJECT
# NAMESPACE	OBJECT	RELATION NAME	SUBJECT
# groups		devs	member		tom
```

### List

Read the [Ory CLI reference](../../cli/ory-list-relation-tuples) to learn more about this command.

```bash
ory list relation-tuples --project=$PROJECT
# NAMESPACE	OBJECT	RELATION NAME	SUBJECT
# groups		devs	member		tom
#
# NEXT PAGE TOKEN
# IS LAST PAGE	true
```

### Delete

Read the [Ory CLI reference](../../cli/ory-delete-relation-tuples) to learn more about this command.

```bash
ory delete relation-tuples --project=$PROJECT --all
# WARNING: This operation is not reversible. Please use the `--force` flag to proceed.
# These tuples would be deleted:
#
# NAMESPACE	OBJECT	RELATION NAME	SUBJECT
# groups		devs	member		tom
#
# NEXT PAGE TOKEN
# IS LAST PAGE	true

## Delete the tuple(s) after making sure this is what you want to do.
ory delete relation-tuples --project=$PROJECT --all --force
```
