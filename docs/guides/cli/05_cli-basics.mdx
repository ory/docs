## Create Ory Cloud Account & Project

With Ory CLI, you can create a new Ory Cloud account and project from your
terminal.

Follow these steps:

1. Run this command to start the wizard:

   ```shell
   ory auth
   ```

2. If you haven't signed in with the CLI before, you're asked if you have an Ory
   Cloud account.

   ```shell
   Do you already have an Ory Console account you wish to use? [y/n]: n
   ```

   Answer "no" to create a new account. In the process, you must provide the
   basic account information: email address, password, user name, and choose if
   you want to be informed about platform security updates.

3. As a final step, accept the [Terms of Service](https://www.ory.sh/ptos).

   ```shell
   I accept the Terms of Service https://www.ory.sh/ptos:  [y/n]: y
   ```

4. When the process is completed, the CLI displays the details of the created account and
the ID of the currently selected project:

   ```text
   You are now signed in as: tom@email.com
   ID			              cae666dg-2ffa-491b-9912-6b090ec10e1c
   EMAIL			          tom@email.com
   SELECTED_PROJECT	      00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
   ```

:::note

By default, no projects are associated with new accounts created through
the Ory CLI. To create a new project, use the [CLI](#create-ory-cloud-project) 
or the [Ory Console](https://console.ory.sh/).

## Create Ory Cloud Project

When the operation is successful, the system returns the details of the newly 
created project:

## Use CLI with Existing Cloud Account

Sign in to use the CLI with your existing Ory Cloud account and project.

1. Run this command to start the wizard:

   ```shell
   ory auth
   ```

2. If you haven't signed in with the CLI before, you're asked if you have an Ory
   Cloud account.

   ```shell
   Do you already have an Ory Console account you wish to use? [y/n]: n
   ```

3. Follow the on-screen instructions to sign in to your account.

   :::info

   If you created your Ory Cloud account with a social sign-in provider, you
   must adjust the account configuration to use the CLI.
   [Read this section for more information](#accounts-with-social-sign-in).

   :::

4. Upon successful sign in, the CLI shows the details of the signed-in user and
   the selected Ory Cloud project:

   ```text
   You are now signed in as: john.wick@company.com
   ID			              7759555-e23a-44b7-b148-7fed7f908024
   EMAIL			          john.wick@company.com
   SELECTED_PROJECT	      00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
   ```

### Accounts with Social Sign-In

If you created your account through a social sign-in provider such as GitHub or
Google, you must adjust your account configuration to use the Ory CLI.

Accounts created with social sign-in providers don't use passwords. To use your
account with Ory CLI, your account must have a password.

Follow these steps to create a password for an account created with a social
sign-in provider:

1. Open the [Ory Console](https://console.ory.sh/) and sign in.
2. Go to your [account settings](https://console.ory.sh/settings).
3. Enter a new password in the **Update Password** field.
4. Click **Save** to finish.
