## Authentication

The Ory CLI comes with multiple authentication mechanisms.

### Browser login

You can authenticate using the `ory auth` command. The command opens a browser window where you can log in to your Ory account.
After logging in, you can use the CLI to manage workspaces, projects, and project data.

:::info

In case you are interested, the Ory CLI uses the authorization code flow with Ory Hydra to authenticate you. Take a look at how
it's implemented in the
[source code](https://github.com/ory/cli/blob/ed90e254aa7113533c1255f639fa1bf1b142de9f/cmd/cloudx/client/auth.go#L143).

### API key

In automated environments like CI/CD pipelines, you can authenticate using API keys. The Ory CLI supports both workspace and
project API keys. Workspace API keys have permissions to manage project configs, while project API keys have permissions to manage
project data. Depending on the use-case you might need to use one or both.

Set the API keys using the `ORY_WORKSPACE_API_KEY` and `ORY_PROJECT_API_KEY` environment variables:

```shell
export ORY_WORKSPACE_API_KEY=ory_wak_8dwW9s....
export ORY_PROJECT_API_KEY=ory_pt_Wse93s....
```

## Set the working context

All commands support the `--workspace` and `--project` flags to specify the working context. Legacy projects without a workspace
can be used by omitting the `--workspace` flag.  
Alternatively, the project and workspace can be specified using the `ORY_PROJECT` and `ORY_WORKSPACE` environment variables.

It is also possible to set the default workspace and project using the `ory use` command:

```shell
ory use workspace $ORY_WORKSPACE
ory use project $ORY_PROJECT
```

## Create a new workspace and project

Run this command to create a new workspace.

```shell
ory create workspace --name "My New Workspace"
```

```bash
# Example response

Workspace created successfully!
ID                 885a2468-c23d-40df-a783-c941387a8701
NAME               My New Workspace
SUBSCRIPTION PLAN  <none>
```

Now export the workspace ID

```
export ORY_WORKSPACE=885a2468-c23d-40df-a783-c941387a8701
```

and run this command to create a new project.

```shell
ory create project --name "My New Project" --workspace $ORY_WORKSPACE
```

```bash
# Example response

Project created successfully!
ID		b7d8a15d-a783-40e6-40df-7acd60cb2b64
