title: Configure Ory OAuth2 and OpenID
---

Using the Ory CLI, you can quickly adjust the configuration of the Ory OAuth2 and OpenID and apply config from the Ory Network
environment to self-hosted Ory Hydra OAuth2 Server instances.

:::tip

[Ory Hydra](https://github.com/ory/hydra) is the open-source project that powers the Ory OAuth2 and OpenID.

:::

This feature is useful for fluently moving your local setup to the cloud, or for working on the configuration and testing
different settings in the safety of the local development environment.

To work with the Ory OAuth2 and OpenID, you must have an active project. Use the [CLI](10_config-with-cli.mdx) or the
[Ory Console](https://console.ory.sh/) to create one.

## Export configuration from Ory Network

To get your project's Ory OAuth2 and OpenID configuration, run this command:

:::info

You must be signed in to an Ory Network account to perform this action. Read [this document](05_cli-basics.mdx) to learn more.

:::

```bash
## List all available workspaces
ory list workspaces

## List all available projects
ory list projects --workspace <workspace-id>

## Get config
ory get oauth2-config --project <project-id> --workspace <workspace-id> --format yaml
```

The `--format` flag defines the format of the output file. You can choose one of `yaml` ,`json`, or `json-pretty`.

Getting the configuration in the YAML format produces output that is ready to use with self-hosted Ory Hydra.

### Export to file

For a convenient way to get the Ory OAuth2 and OpenID configuration working in self-hosted Ory Hydra, save the configuration to a
YAML file.

Run this command:

```bash
ory get oauth2-config --project <project-id> --workspace <workspace-id> --format yaml > oauth2-config.yaml
```

## Import configuration to Ory Network

To start using the configuration from a self-hosted Ory Hydra instance in Ory OAuth2 and OpenID, import the configuration file
with the CLI:

```shell
ory update oauth2-config --project <project-id> --workspace <workspace-id> --file config.yaml
```

## Adjust specific keys

You can adjust specific keys in the configuration using the `ory patch` CLI command.

Running this sample command sets the time to live (`ttl`) for refresh tokens to `999h0m0s`:

```shell
ory patch oauth2-config --project <project-id> --workspace <workspace-id> \
  --replace '/ttl/refresh_token="999h0m0s"'
```
