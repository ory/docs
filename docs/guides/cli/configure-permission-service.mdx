Using the Ory CLI, you can quickly adjust the configuration of the Ory Cloud Permission Service and apply config from the Cloud
environment to self-hosted Ory Keto instances.

:::tip

Ory Keto is the open-source project that powers the Ory Cloud Permission Service.

:::

This feature is useful for fluently moving your local setup to the Cloud, or for working on the configuration and testing
different settings in the safety of the local development environment.

To work with the Ory Cloud Permission Service, you must have an active Ory Cloud project. Use the
[CLI](./config-with-cli#create-ory-cloud-project) or the [Ory Console](https://console.ory.sh/) to create one.

## Export Configuration from Ory Cloud

To get your project's Permission Service configuration, run this command:

:::info

You must be signed in to an Ory Cloud account to perform this action. Read
[this document](./cli-basics#use-cli-with-existing-cloud-account) to learn more.

:::

```bash
## List all available projects
ory list projects

## Get config
ory get permission-config <project-id> --format yaml
```

The `--format` flag defines the format of the output file. You can choose one of `yaml` ,`json`, or `json-pretty`.

Getting the configuration in the YAML format produces output that is ready to use with self-hosted Ory Keto.

### Export to File

For a convenient way to get the Permission Service configuration working in self-hosted Ory Keto, save the configuration to a YAML
file.

Run this command:

```bash
ory get permission-config <project-id> --format yaml > identity-config.yaml
```

## Import Configuration to Ory Cloud

To start using the configuration from a self-hosted Ory Keto instance in the Ory Cloud Permission Service, import the
configuration file with the CLI:

```shell
ory update permission-config <project-id> --file config.yaml
```

## Adjust Specific Keys

You can adjust specific keys in the configuration using the `ory patch` CLI command.

Running this sample command sets the `/limit/max_read_depth` key value to `3`:

```shell
ory patch permission-config <project-id> \
  --replace '/limit/max_read_depth=3'
```
