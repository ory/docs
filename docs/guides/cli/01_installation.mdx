The Ory CLI is a convenient and easy-to-use tool that helps you manage and configure Ory Network projects.

Its functionality is essential for self-hosting Ory components and local development. The built-in tunneling mechanism help route
application traffic to the appropriate endpoints in a safe and hassle-free manner.

The ability to export configurations allows you to bring your setup from a self-hosted environment to the cloud and from The Ory
Network to self-hosted setups alike.

## Installation

```mdx-code-block
import Install from '@site/docs/_common/install-cli.mdx'

<Install />
```

#### Docker

```shell
### Pull Ory CLI image

You can download the server and client binaries from the [GitHub "releases" tab](https://github.com/ory/cli/releases).

`/usr/local/bin`.
