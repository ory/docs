Ory CLI is a convenient and easy-to-use tool that helps you manage and configure Ory Cloud and self-hosted projects.

Its functionality is essential for self-hosting Ory components and local development. The built-in proxy and tunneling mechanisms
help route application traffic to the appropriate endpoints in a safe and hassle-free manner.

The ability to export configurations allows you to bring your setup from a self-hosted environment to the cloud and from Ory Cloud
to self-hosted setups alike.
