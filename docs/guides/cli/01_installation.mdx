Ory CLI is a convenient and easy-to-use tool that helps you manage and configure The Ory Network.

Its functionality is essential for self-hosting Ory components and local development. The built-in proxy and tunneling mechanisms
help route application traffic to the appropriate endpoints in a safe and hassle-free manner.

The ability to export configurations allows you to bring your setup from a self-hosted environment to the cloud and from The Ory
Network to self-hosted setups alike.

## Installation

You can install Ory CLI directly on your machine, or run the tool in Docker.

### macOS

Run this command to install the CLI using Homebrew:

```shell
brew install ory/tap/cli
```

Verify the installation:

```shell
ory help
```

### Linux

Ory CLI works on all Linux distributions. Run this command to install:

```shell
bash <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ory/meta/master/install.sh) -b . ory
```

You may want to move the Ory CLI to your `$PATH`:

```shell
sudo mv ./ory /usr/local/bin/
```

Verify the installation after moving to `$PATH`:

```shell
ory help
```

### Windows

To install the CLI on Windows, use [scoop](https://scoop.sh). Run:

```shell
> scoop bucket add ory https://github.com/ory/scoop.git
> scoop install ory
```

Verify the installation:

```shell
ory help
```

### Docker

docker pull oryd/ory

### Run image, enter container, and run a CLI command
docker run --rm -it oryd/ory help
```

### Binary

You can download the server and client binaries from the [GitHub "releases" tab](https://github.com/ory/cli/releases).

To install, add the binary to the `PATH` environment variable or move it to a path that's already in your `$PATH`, for example
`/usr/local/bin`.
