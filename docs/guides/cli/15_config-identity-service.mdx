title: Configure Identity Service
---

Using the Ory CLI, you can quickly adjust the configuration of the Ory Cloud
Identity Service and apply config from the Cloud environment to self-hosted
Ory Kratos instances. 

:::tip

Ory Kratos is the open-source project that powers the Ory Cloud Identity Service.

:::

This feature is useful for fluently moving your local setup to the Cloud, or 
for working on the configuration and testing different settings in the safety 
of the local development environment. 

## Export Configuration from Ory Cloud

To get your project's Identity Service configuration, run this command:

:::info

You must be signed in to an Ory Cloud account to perform this action. 
Read [this document](./cli-basics#use-cli-with-existing-cloud-account) to learn more. 

:::

```bash
ory get identity-config <project-id> --format yaml
```

The `--format` flag defines the format of the output file. You can choose one of `yaml`
,`json`, or `json-pretty`. 

Getting the configuration in the YAML format produces output that is ready 
to use with self-hosted Ory Kratos. 

### Export to File

For a convenient way to get the Identity Service configuration 
working in self-hosted Ory Kratos, save the configuration to a YAML file.

Run this command:

```bash
ory get identity-config <project-id> --format yaml >identity-config.yaml 
```

## Import Configuration to Ory Cloud

To start using using the configuration from a self-hosted Ory Kratos instance
in the Ory Cloud Identity Service, import the configuration file with the CLI:

```shell
ory update identity-config <project-id> --file config.yaml
```

## Adjust Specific Keys

You can adjust specific keys in the configuration using the `ory patch` CLI command. 

Running this sample command sets the `/selfservice/methods/totp/enabled` key value to `false`:

```shell
ory patch identity-config <project-id> \ 
  --replace '/selfservice/methods/totp/enabled=false'
```

with the Ory CLI.
