title: Ory Identities CLI
---

Using the Ory CLI, you can quickly adjust the configuration of the Ory Identities and apply config from the Ory Network
environment to self-hosted Ory Kratos Identity Server instances.

:::tip

[Ory Kratos](https://github.com/ory/kratos) is the open-source project that powers the Ory Identities.

:::

This feature is useful for fluently moving your local setup to the cloud, or for working on the configuration and testing
different settings in the safety of the local development environment.

To work with the Ory Identities, you must have an active project. Use the [CLI](./config-with-cli#create-ory-cloud-project) or the
[Ory Console](https://console.ory.com/) to create one.

## Export configuration from Ory Network

To get your project's Ory Identities configuration, run this command:

:::info

You must be signed in to an Ory Network account to perform this action. Read
[this document](./cli-basics#use-cli-with-existing-cloud-account) to learn more.

:::

```bash
## List all available workspaces
ory list workspaces

## List all available projects
ory list projects --workspace <workspace-id>

## Get config
ory get identity-config --project <project-id> --workspace <workspace-id> --format yaml
```

The `--format` flag defines the format of the output file. You can choose one of `yaml` ,`json`, or `json-pretty`.

Getting the configuration in the YAML format produces output that is ready to use with self-hosted Ory Kratos.

### Export to file

For a convenient way to get the Ory Identities configuration working in self-hosted Ory Kratos, save the configuration to a YAML
file.

Run this command:

```bash
ory get identity-config --project <project-id> --workspace <workspace-id> --format yaml > identity-config.yaml
```

## Import configuration to Ory Network

To start using the configuration from a self-hosted Ory Kratos instance in Ory Identities, import the configuration file with the
CLI:

```shell
ory update identity-config --project <project-id> --workspace <workspace-id> --file config.yaml
```

## Adjust specific keys

You can adjust specific keys in the configuration using the `ory patch` CLI command.

Running this sample command sets the `/selfservice/methods/totp/enabled` key value to `false`:

```shell
ory patch identity-config --project <project-id> --workspace <workspace-id> \
  --replace '/selfservice/methods/totp/enabled=false'
```
