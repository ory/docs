title: Configure Projects with Ory CLI
---

All Ory components use the same configuration format and APIs whether they are self-hosted or consumed through Ory Cloud.

This allows you to use the Ory CLI to configure your components, no matter how you use Ory!

:::note

This feature is currently in development. More configuration options are added with new CLI releases

## Configuring Projects

There are two ways to adjust the configuration of Ory Cloud projects. You can:

- overwite / import configuration from a file using the `ory update` command
- patch the existing configuration using the `ory patch` command

### Overwrite / Import Configuration

To overwrite the entire project configuration or to import a brand new config, create a file with the configuration you want to
use.

The configuration format follows the [updateProject API request payload](../../reference/api.mdx#operation/updateProject).

:::note

The `/services/identity/config` key is compatible with the
[Ory Kratos configuration format](../../kratos/reference/configuration.md) except for some keys (for example `serve`, `dsn`) which
are ignored.

```json
{
  "services": {
    "identity": {
      "config": ...
    }
  }
}
```

:::

Let's look at an example. If you want to change the name of the email sender for recovery and verification emails, create a
configuration file that looks like this:

```json title="config.json"
{
  "name": "My Project Name"
  "services": {
    "identity": {
      "config": {
        "courier": {
          "smtp": {
            "from_name": "My Custom E-Mail Name"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Next, use the Ory CLI to apply the config:

```shell
ory update project <your-project-id> --file config.json
```

### Patch Configuration

When you want to change specific parts of the configuration instead of overwriting the entire config, use the `ory patch` command.

Use this command in combination with [JSON Patch](http://jsonpatch.com/) to target individual keys.

To perform an update similar to the one described in the previous paragraph and change the name of the email sender for recovery
and verification emails, run this command:

```
ory patch project <your-project-id> \
  --replace '/services/identity/config/courier/smtp/from_name="My Custom E-Mail Name"'
```

Use the `--replace` flag to indicate the key you want to change.

:::tip

When patching configuration, the part after `=` is interpreted as raw JSON. Use these format to patch the desired data types:

- String: `/path/to/key="my string"`
- Boolean: `/path/to/key=true`
- Number: `/path/to/key=123`
- Complex: `/path/to/key={"my": ["vaules", {"foo":"bar"}]}`
