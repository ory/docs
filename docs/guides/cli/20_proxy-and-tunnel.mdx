title: Ory Proxy and Ory Tunnel
---

The CLI contains two tools that help with local development:

- Ory Proxy
- Ory Tunnel

Before you start using these tools, export the SDK of your project. Run this command:

```shell
export ORY_SDK_URL=https://{your-project-slug-here}.projects.oryapis.com

# For a quick way to test, use the playground project:
export ORY_SDK_URL=https://playground.projects.oryapis.com
```

:::info

The main use case for Ory Tunnel and Ory Proxy is local development, but it can also be used in production, on different server
types, and in Docker. You can use Ory Tunnel in the same way you use Ory Proxy. Read about the
[differences](#differences-between-ory-tunnel-and-ory-proxy) between the two at the end of this document.

:::

## Ory Tunnel

Ory Tunnel is exposing the Ory APIs under the same top-level domain as your application to ensure that there are no CORS issues.

To run Ory Tunnel, use the `ory tunnel` command and point to the URL with your application, for example:

```shell
ory tunnel --project $PROJECT_SLUG http://localhost:3000
```

To get a full list of arguments and options available for use with Ory Tunnel, run: `ory tunnel --help`

For more details, refer to the [Ory Proxy documentation](#ory-proxy) and the
[differences between Ory Tunnel and Ory Proxy](#differences-between-ory-tunnel-and-ory-proxy).

## Ory Proxy

Ory Proxy is a reverse proxy deployed in front of your application. This allows the Ory endpoints to be mirrored on the same
domain as the app you're running.

Ory Proxy rewrites cookies to match the domain your application is currently on. As a result, the origin of the cookies is set to
the domain you run the app on instead of `<your-project-slug>.projects.oryapis.com`.

This behavior is necessary to avoid issues with the browsers
[CORS policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy).

Ory Proxy converts sessions into JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) and ensures that cookies and URLs are properly configured.

:::info

Using Ory Proxy is an alternative to [custom domains (CNAME)](../custom-domains), and a useful tool when developing locally. In
production, it's recommended to use a CNAME.

:::

When an application runs on `http://localhost:3000`, Ory must be available on the same domain, for example at
`http://localhost:4000`. Thanks to such setup, the system can manage Anti-CSRF Cookies and Ory Session Cookies.

```mdx-code-block
import Mermaid from "@site/src/theme/Mermaid"

<Mermaid
  chart={`
flowchart TD
    A[Developer] -->|GET http://localhost:1234| B(Ory Proxy)
    B -->|GET /.ory/*| D[Ory Network]
    B -->E[Your application]
`}
/>
```

### URL structure

:::tip

Ory Proxy adds `/.ory` prefix when mirroring APIs and UIs of Ory Network.

:::

For example, when using the Ory Proxy, calling `https://<proxy-host>/.ory/ui/login` is the same as calling
`https://<your-project-slug>.projects.oryapis.com/ui/login` directly.

Ory Proxy provides URLs which you can use to start self-service flows:

| URL                                       | Self-service Flow                                                          |
| :---------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/.ory/self-service/login/browser`        | [Login](/kratos/self-service/flows/user-login)                             |
| `/.ory/self-service/registration/browser` | [Registration](/kratos/self-service/flows/user-registration)               |
| `/.ory/self-service/recovery/browser`     | [Recovery](/kratos/self-service/flows/account-recovery-password-reset)     |
| `/.ory/self-service/verification/browser` | [Verification](/kratos/self-service/flows/verify-email-account-activation) |
| `/.ory/self-service/settings/browser`     | [Settings](/kratos/self-service/flows/user-settings)                       |

If you redirect or link the user to one of those paths, the corresponding self-service flow is started, for example:

```html
<a href="/.ory/self-service/login/browser">Log in</a>
```

You can also append a `return_to=<your-url>` query parameter to the URL. This redirects the user to the set URL when they complete
the self-service flow.

```html
<a href="/.ory/self-service/login/browser?return_to=https://localhost:4000/my-url">Log in</a>
```

:::info

The domain used in `return_to` must be an allow-listed URL set in the project configuration. The URL must include the protocol and
domain. Relative URLs aren't supported.

:::

### Use Ory Proxy for local development

When using Ory Proxy for local development, point to the URL where your application runs.

For example, if your application is available at `http://localhost:3000`, run this command:

```shell
ory proxy http://localhost:3000
```

By default, Ory Proxy creates an entry point at `http://localhost:4000`. To get access to Ory endpoints, you must access the app
through the proxy using This URL instead of the actual address on which your application is running.

If you want to adjust the entry point URL, pass the desired address along with the application URL, for example:

```shell
ory proxy http://localhost:3000 http://localhost:3001
```

### Use Ory Proxy with JSON Web Tokens

Ory Proxy translates known Ory credentials, such as Ory Session Tokens or Ory Session Cookies, to JSON Web Tokens.

When the user calls Ory Proxy with a valid Ory Session Cookie:

```shell
GET /some-path
Host: localhost:4000
Cookie: ory_session_jollyproskuriakovaxe98qw5t8g=MTYyNzU1OTgyNHxEdi1CQkFFQ180SUFBUkFCRUFBQVJfLUNBQUVHYzNSeWFXNW5EQThBRFhObGMzTnBiMjVmZEc5clpXNEdjM1J5YVc1bkRDSUFJR3RGU1d4dlUwOXVSR2w1UjJONmFVRlhaWEIxWVhCVlNHWlZOVTQxWWtGMnwhbFZh8BCCQ3tMemDczrB9-epefXl1E7whiChUt62LuA==
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/91.0.4472.164 Safari/537.36
...
```

Ory Proxy resolves the session and converts it to a JSON Web Token. The token is included in the `Authorization` HTTP header of
the request made to the application behind Ory Proxy.

The session is also included in the request so that you can use it for example to generate a logout URL.

```
GET /some-path
Host: <your-application>:3000
Authorization: eyJhbGciOiJFUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJl...",
Cookie: ory_session_jollyproskuriakovaxe98qw5t8g=MTYyNzU1OTgyNHxEdi1CQkFF...
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko)
```

it's recommended you to validate the JWT using Ory Proxy's public key. The public key is available at `/.ory/proxy/jwks.json`:

```shell
curl -sk https://<proxy-host>/.ory/proxy/jwks.json | jq
{
  "keys": [
    {
      "use": "sig",
      "kty": "EC",
      "kid": "f8f2e6ff-0480-4343-9dee-0d2a463146dc",
      "crv": "P-256",
      "alg": "ES256",
      "x": "Say2LSWvHxUnyxuW5lxsTFkKopZq402eH4YqcRiBgvA",
      "y": "7XaYgYsW-Mjb5qIq47LxyaPHjPZfRHRnnfir8aqd9BU"
    }
  ]
}
```

The token contains all session and identity information linked to the Ory Session Cookie.

This is an example of a JWT with session and identity data:

```json

  "exp": 1627560124,
  "iat": 1627560064,

    }
  },
  "sub": "0f0c9bec-6b68-47f3-b62b-7750f065359c"
}
```

### Use Ory Proxy when self-hosting

You can use Ory Proxy in a production setup when self-hosting Ory components. Set the entry point URL to the domain where you want
to expose the app through the Ory Proxy:

```shell
ory proxy http://localhost:3000 https://my-domain.com
```

### Use Ory Proxy with virtual and dedicated servers

To use Ory Proxy with an application deployed on a VM or a Dedicated Server, run the application server and Ory Proxy in parallel.

For example, if you are running a Node.js server on port `3000` and you expose web traffic on port `8080`:

```shell
ory proxy --port 8080 http://127.0.0.1:3000 https://your-domain.com &

# This should be your server command
node your-entrypoint.js
```

:::tip

Ory Proxy should never be the main entry point to your application. Always run an ingress proxy such as Nginx or Traefik in front.

:::

### Use Ory Proxy in Docker

To use Ory Proxy in Docker, add your application and Ory Proxy to a single Docker container.

:::info

This isn't a perfect solution as Docker watches the processes running in the foreground. With the application and Ory Proxy in one
container, you must decide which becomes the foreground process.

When a process crashes, Docker notifies just of the failures of the foreground process and gives no information about the
background process.

In this example, Ory Proxy is the background process.

Read the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/multi-service_container/) to learn more about running
multiple processes in a single container.

:::

To run Ory Proxy in one container with your application, create an `entrypoint.sh` file like this:

```shell
#!/bin/bash
set -e

# This assumes that your server is running on port 3000. If it's running on a different port,
# remember to adjust the command to point to the port where your server is running at!
ory proxy --port 8080 http://127.0.0.1:3000 https://your-domain.com &

# This should be your server command
node your-entrypoint.js

# Or, depending on the tech you use:
#   go run main.go
#   php index.php
#   ...
```

Then, add the script to your Dockerfile and run it:

```Dockerfile
# ...

EXPOSE 8080

COPY ./docker-entrypoint.sh /
ENTRYPOINT ["/docker-entrypoint.sh"]
```

## Differences between Ory Tunnel and Ory Proxy

Ory Tunnel shares most of its code with the Ory Proxy, and from the user's point of view, it works similarly. Several important
differences between Ory Proxy and Ory Tunnel:

- Ory Tunnel routes traffic to Ory Network APIs, while Ory Proxy is a reverse proxy deployed in front of your application,
  mirroring Ory Network endpoints on the same domain as your app.
- Ory Proxy adds the `/.ory` prefix when mirroring APIs and UIs of Ory Network, while Ory Tunnel doesn't mirror Ory URLs and
  doesn't add the `/.ory` prefix to any of the Ory URLs.
- Ory Tunnel doesn't alter incoming HTTP headers
- Ory Proxy converts sessions into JWTs, while Ory Tunnel doesn't use JWTs natively.
