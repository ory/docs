title: Ory Tunnel
---

The CLI contains two tools that help with local development:

- Ory Tunnel
- Ory Proxy (Deprecated)

:::info

The main use case for Ory Tunnel is local development, and should not be used in production.

:::

## Ory Tunnel

Ory Tunnel is exposing the Ory APIs under the same top-level domain as your application to ensure that there are no CORS issues.

To run Ory Tunnel, use the `ory tunnel` command and point to the URL with your application, for example:

```shell
ory tunnel --project <project-id> --workspace <workspace-id> http://localhost:3000
```

To get a full list of arguments and options available for use with Ory Tunnel, run: `ory help tunnel`

When an application runs on `http://localhost:3000`, Ory must be available on the same domain, for example at
`http://localhost:4000`. With this setup, the system can manage Anti-CSRF Cookies and Ory Session Cookies.

```mdx-code-block
import Mermaid from "@site/src/theme/Mermaid"

<Mermaid
  chart={`
flowchart TD
    A[Developer] -->| GET localhost:1234 | B(Ory Tunnel)
    B -->|GET /*| D[Ory Network]
    B -->E[Your application]
`}
/>
```

### Using Ory Tunnel for local development

When using Ory Tunnel for local development, point to the URL where your application runs.

For example, if your application is available at `http://localhost:3000`, run this command:

```shell
ory tunnel --project <project-id> --workspace <workspace-id> http://localhost:3000
```

By default, Ory Tunnel creates an entry point at `http://localhost:4000`. To get access to Ory endpoints, you must access the app
through the tunnel using this URL instead of the actual address on which your application is running.

If you want to adjust the entry point URL, pass the desired address along with the application URL, for example:

```shell
ory tunnel --project <project-id> --workspace <workspace-id> http://localhost:3000 http://localhost:3001
```

## Migration from Proxy to Tunnel

Ory Proxy has been deprecated in favor of Ory Tunnel. This section guides you through migrating from Proxy to Tunnel.

### Command changes

Replace your existing Proxy commands with their Tunnel equivalents:

| Proxy Command                                                | Tunnel Command                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ory proxy --project <id> http://localhost:3000`             | `ory tunnel --project <id> http://localhost:3000`             |
| `ory proxy --project <id> --port 8080 http://localhost:3000` | `ory tunnel --project <id> --port 8080 http://localhost:3000` |

### Key differences to be aware of

1. **URL structure**: Ory Tunnel doesn't use the `/.ory` prefix that Proxy used. Requests are sent directly to the corresponding
   path.

2. **HTTP headers**: Tunnel doesn't modify HTTP headers like Proxy did.

3. **Environment variables**: Use `ORY_PROJECT_ID=<id> npm run tunnel` instead of `ORY_PROJECT_ID=<id> npm run proxy` in your
   scripts.

### Application code updates

If your application code relies on Proxy-specific behavior, you'll need to update:

- References to `/.ory/` paths in your frontend code

## Ory Proxy (deprecated)

:::warning

DEPRECATED Ory Proxy has been deprecated and is no longer recommended for new implementations. Please use Ory Tunnel instead,
which provides similar functionality with an improved architecture. This documentation is kept for reference purposes for users
who still have Ory Proxy in their existing implementations.

:::

Ory Proxy is a reverse proxy deployed in front of your application. This allows the Ory endpoints to be mirrored on the same
domain as the app you're running.

Ory Proxy rewrites cookies to match the domain your application is currently on. As a result, the origin of the cookies is set to
the domain you run the app on instead of `<your-project-slug>.projects.oryapis.com`.

This behavior is necessary to avoid issues with the browsers
[CORS policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy).

Ory Proxy converts sessions into JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) and ensures that cookies and URLs are properly configured.

### URL structure

:::tip

Ory Proxy adds `/.ory` prefix when mirroring APIs and UIs of Ory Network.

:::

For example, when using the Ory Proxy, calling `https://<proxy-host>/.ory/ui/login` is the same as calling
`https://<your-project-slug>.projects.oryapis.com/ui/login` directly.

Ory Proxy provides URLs which you can use to start self-service flows:

| URL                                       | Self-service Flow                                                          |
| :---------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/.ory/self-service/login/browser`        | [Login](/kratos/self-service/flows/user-login)                             |
| `/.ory/self-service/registration/browser` | [Registration](/kratos/self-service/flows/user-registration)               |
| `/.ory/self-service/recovery/browser`     | [Recovery](/kratos/self-service/flows/account-recovery-password-reset)     |
| `/.ory/self-service/verification/browser` | [Verification](/kratos/self-service/flows/verify-email-account-activation) |
| `/.ory/self-service/settings/browser`     | [Settings](/kratos/self-service/flows/user-settings)                       |

If you redirect or link the user to one of those paths, the corresponding self-service flow is started, for example:

```html
<a href="/.ory/self-service/login/browser">Log in</a>
```

You can also append a `return_to=<your-url>` query parameter to the URL. This redirects the user to the set URL when they complete
the self-service flow.

```html
<a href="/.ory/self-service/login/browser?return_to=https://localhost:4000/my-url">Log in</a>
```

:::info

The domain used in `return_to` must be an allow-listed URL set in the project configuration. The URL must include the protocol and
domain. Relative URLs aren't supported.

:::

### Use Ory Proxy with JSON Web Tokens

Ory Proxy translates known Ory credentials, such as Ory Session Tokens or Ory Session Cookies, to JSON Web Tokens.

When the user calls Ory Proxy with a valid Ory Session Cookie:

```shell
GET /some-path
Host: localhost:4000
Cookie: ory_session_jollyproskuriakovaxe98qw5t8g=MTYyNzU1OTgyNHxEdi1CQkFFQ180SUFBUkFCRUFBQVJfLUNBQUVHYzNSeWFXNW5EQThBRFhObGMzTnBiMjVmZEc5clpXNEdjM1J5YVc1bkRDSUFJR3RGU1d4dlUwOXVSR2w1UjJONmFVRlhaWEIxWVhCVlNHWlZOVTQxWWtGMnwhbFZh8BCCQ3tMemDczrB9-epefXl1E7whiChUt62LuA==
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/91.0.4472.164 Safari/537.36
...
```

Ory Proxy resolves the session and converts it to a JSON Web Token. The token is included in the `Authorization` HTTP header of
the request made to the application behind Ory Proxy.

The session is also included in the request so that you can use it for example to generate a logout URL.

```
GET /some-path
Host: <your-application>:3000
Authorization: eyJhbGciOiJFUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJl...",
Cookie: ory_session_jollyproskuriakovaxe98qw5t8g=MTYyNzU1OTgyNHxEdi1CQkFF...
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko)
```

it's recommended you to validate the JWT using Ory Proxy's public key. The public key is available at `/.ory/proxy/jwks.json`:

```shell
curl -sk https://<proxy-host>/.ory/proxy/jwks.json | jq
{
  "keys": [
    {
      "use": "sig",
      "kty": "EC",
      "kid": "f8f2e6ff-0480-4343-9dee-0d2a463146dc",
      "crv": "P-256",
      "alg": "ES256",
      "x": "Say2LSWvHxUnyxuW5lxsTFkKopZq402eH4YqcRiBgvA",
      "y": "7XaYgYsW-Mjb5qIq47LxyaPHjPZfRHRnnfir8aqd9BU"
    }
  ]
}
```

The token contains all session and identity information linked to the Ory Session Cookie.

This is an example of a JWT with session and identity data:

```json

  "exp": 1627560124,
  "iat": 1627560064,

    }
  },
  "sub": "0f0c9bec-6b68-47f3-b62b-7750f065359c"
}
```

### Use Ory Proxy with virtual and dedicated servers

To use Ory Proxy with an application deployed on a VM or a Dedicated Server, run the application server and Ory Proxy in parallel.

For example, if you are running a Node.js server on port `3000` and you expose web traffic on port `8080`:

```shell
ory proxy --project <project-id> --workspace <workspace-id> --port 8080 http://127.0.0.1:3000 https://your-domain.com &

# This should be your server command
node your-entrypoint.js
```

Ory Proxy should never be the main entry point to your application. Always run an ingress proxy such as Nginx or Traefik in front.

### Use Ory Proxy in Docker

To use Ory Proxy in Docker, add your application and Ory Proxy to a single Docker container.

This isn't a perfect solution as Docker watches the processes running in the foreground. With the application and Ory Proxy in one
container, you must decide which becomes the foreground process.

When a process crashes, Docker notifies just of the failures of the foreground process and gives no information about the
background process.

In this example, Ory Proxy is the background process.

Read the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/multi-service_container/) to learn more about running
multiple processes in a single container.

To run Ory Proxy in one container with your application, create an `entrypoint.sh` file like this:

```shell
#!/bin/bash
set -e

# This assumes that your server is running on port 3000. If it's running on a different port,
# remember to adjust the command to point to the port where your server is running at!
ory proxy --project <project-id> --workspace <workspace-id> --port 8080 http://127.0.0.1:3000 https://your-domain.com &

# This should be your server command
node your-entrypoint.js

# Or, depending on the tech you use:
#   go run main.go
#   php index.php
#   ...
```

Then, add the script to your Dockerfile and run it:

```Dockerfile
# ...

EXPOSE 8080

COPY ./docker-entrypoint.sh /
ENTRYPOINT ["/docker-entrypoint.sh"]
```

## Differences between Ory Tunnel and Ory Proxy

Ory Tunnel shares most of its code with the Ory Proxy, and from the user's point of view, it works similarly. Several important
differences between Ory Proxy and Ory Tunnel:

- Ory Tunnel routes traffic to Ory Network APIs, while Ory Proxy is a reverse proxy deployed in front of your application,
  mirroring Ory Network endpoints on the same domain as your app.
- Ory Proxy adds the `/.ory` prefix when mirroring APIs and UIs of Ory Network, while Ory Tunnel doesn't mirror Ory URLs and
  doesn't add the `/.ory` prefix to any of the Ory URLs.
- Ory Tunnel doesn't alter incoming HTTP headers
- Ory Proxy converts sessions into JWTs, while Ory Tunnel doesn't use JWTs natively.
