Ory Network has optional features that may be turned on or off.

:::note

The availability of certain features is dependent on the project plan.

:::

## Session caching

Turning this feature on, enables cached session check responses. This helps reduce the latency for subsequent whoami responses
after the first query. The tradeoff worth considering is that the embedded identity representation will have eventual consistency
(post expiry of the cached session).

:::note

Projects on Business plan or higher can use the Session caching feature.

:::

Once the feature has been turned on, the cache duration can be controlled by the clients by setting the `max-age` value in the
`Cache-Control` header. To do so, the specified header value has to be lower than the
[session lifespan configuration](../kratos/session-management/session-lifespan).
