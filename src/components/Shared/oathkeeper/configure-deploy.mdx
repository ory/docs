The Ory Oathkeeper HTTP serve process `oathkeeper serve` opens two ports exposing the

- [reverse proxy](index.mdx#reverse-proxy)
- REST API which serves the [Access Control Decision API](index.mdx#access-control-decision-api) as well as other API endpoints
  such as health checks, JSON Web Key Sets, and a list of available rules.

For this guide we're using Docker. Ory Oathkeeper however can be [installed in a variety of ways](install.mdx).

## Configure

Ory Oathkeeper can be configured via the filesystem as well as environment variables. For more information on mapping the keys to
environment variables please head over to the [configuration chapter](reference/configuration.mdx).

First, create an empty directory and `cd` into it:

```shell
mkdir oathkeeper-demo
cd oathkeeper-demo
```

Create a file called `config.yaml` with the following content:

```shell
cat << EOF > config.yaml
serve:
  proxy:
    port: 4455 # run the proxy at port 4455
  api:
    port: 4456 # run the api at port 4456

access_rules:
  repositories:
    - file:///rules.json

errors:
  fallback:
    - json
  handlers:
    json:
      enabled: true
      config:
        verbose: true
    redirect:
      enabled: true
      config:
        to: https://www.ory.com/docs

mutators:
  header:
    enabled: true
    config:
      headers:
        X-User: "{{ print .Subject }}"
        # You could add some other headers, for example with data from the
        # session.
        # X-Some-Arbitrary-Data: "{{ print .Extra.some.arbitrary.data }}"
  noop:
    enabled: true
  id_token:
    enabled: true
    config:
      issuer_url: http://localhost:4455/
      jwks_url: file:///jwks.json

authorizers:
  allow:
    enabled: true
  deny:
    enabled: true

authenticators:
  anonymous:
    enabled: true
    config:
      subject: guest
EOF
```

This configuration file will run the proxy at port 4455, the api at port 4456, and enable the anonymous authenticator, the allow
and deny authorizers, and the noop and id_token mutators.

### Access rules

We will be using [httpbin.org](https://httpbin.org) as the upstream server. The service echoes incoming HTTP Requests and is
perfect for seeing how Ory Oathkeeper works. Let's define three rules:

1. An access rule that allowing anonymous access to `https://httpbin.org/anything/header` and using the `header` mutator.
2. An access rule denying every access to `https://httpbin.org/anything/deny`. If the request header has
   `Accept: application/json`, we will receive a JSON response. If however the accept header has `Accept: text/*`, a HTTP Redirect
   will be sent (to `https://www.ory.com/docs` as configured above).
3. An access rule allowing anonymous access to `https://httpbin.org/anything/id_token` using the `id_token` mutator.

### Cryptographic keys

The `id_token` mutator creates a signed JSON Web Token. For that to work, a public/private key is required. Luckily, Ory
Oathkeeper can assist you in creating such keys. All common JWT algorithms are supported (RS256, ES256, HS256, ...). Let's
generate a key for the RS256 algorithm that will be used by the id_token mutator:

```mdx-code-block
<CodeBlock className="language-shell">{`docker run oryd/oathkeeper:${useLatestRelease('oathkeeper')} credentials generate --alg RS256 > jwks.json`}</CodeBlock>
```

### Dockerfile

Next we will be creating a custom Docker Image that adds these configuration files to the image:

```mdx-code-block

<CodeBlock className="language-shell">{`cat << EOF > Dockerfile
FROM oryd/oathkeeper:${useLatestRelease('oathkeeper')}
ADD config.yaml /config.yaml
ADD rules.json /rules.json
ADD jwks.json /jwks.json
EOF`}</CodeBlock>

```

We're doing this for demonstration purposes only. In a production environment you would separate these configuration values from
the build artifact itself. In Kubernetes, it would make most sense to provide the JSON Web Keys as a Kubernetes Secret mounted as
in a directory, for example.

We encourage you to check out our [helm charts](https://k8s.ory.com/helm/) which apply these best practices.

## Build & run

Before building the Docker Image, we need to make sure that the local Ory Oathkeeper Docker Image is on the most recent version:

```mdx-code-block
<CodeBlock className="language-shell">{`docker pull oryd/oathkeeper:${useLatestRelease('oathkeeper')}`}</CodeBlock>
```

Next we will build our custom Docker Image

```sh
docker build -t ory-oathkeeper-demo .
```

and run it

```sh
docker run --rm \
  --name ory-oathkeeper-demo \
  -p 4455:4455 \
  -p 4456:4456 \
  ory-oathkeeper-demo \
  --config /config.yaml \
  serve
```

Let's open a new terminal and check if it's alive:

```sh
curl http://127.0.0.1:4456/health/alive
{"status":"ok"}

curl http://127.0.0.1:4456/health/ready
{"status":"ok"}
```

Let's also check if the rules have been imported properly:

```sh
curl http://127.0.0.1:4456/rules
[{"id":"allow-anonymous-with-header-mutator","description":"","match":{"methods":["GET"],...
```

## Authorize requests

Everything is up and running and configured! Let's make some requests:

```sh
curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:4455/anything/header
{
  "args": {},
  "data": "",
  "files": {},
  "form": {},
  "headers": {
    "Accept": "*/*",
    "Accept-Encoding": "gzip",
    "Host": "httpbin.org",
    "User-Agent": "curl/7.54.0",
    "X-User": "guest"
  },
  "json": null,
  "method": "GET",
  "origin": "172.17.0.1, 82.135.11.242, 172.17.0.1",
  "url": "https://httpbin.org/anything/header/anything/header"
}

# Make request and accept JSON (we get an error response)
curl -H "Accept: application/json" -X GET http://127.0.0.1:4455/anything/deny
{
  "error":{
    "code":403,
    "status":"Forbidden",
    "message":"Access credentials aren't sufficient to access this resource"
  }
}

# Make request and accept text/* (we get a redirect response).
curl -H "Accept: text/html" -X GET http://127.0.0.1:4455/anything/deny
<a href="https://www.ory.com/docs">Found</a>.

curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:4455/anything/id_token
{
  "args": {},
  "data": "",
  "files": {},
  "form": {},
  "headers": {
    "Accept": "*/*",
    "Accept-Encoding": "gzip",
    "Authorization": "Bearer eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6IjU3N2E2NWE0LTUzM2YtNDFhYi1hODI2LTgxNDliMDM2NDQ0MyIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJleHAiOjE1NTgwMTg1MTcsImlhdCI6MTU1ODAxODQ1NywiaXNzIjoiaHR0cDovL2xvY2FsaG9zdDo0NDU1LyIsImp0aSI6IjExNmRiNzhmLTQyMjEtNDU2ZC05OWIzLTY4NGJkMWVjYThjZSIsIm5iZiI6MTU1ODAxODQ1Nywic3ViIjoiZ3Vlc3QifQ.2VKW-oYtzkFGRPgK3sb4iRlObDSzW8PyHzgNiQubppFSlp0bzJLl4Rnt56orJndPqIa7hwsm8YIskf-Wp-FA1piv-aG_XljkUjgilKr3cncMXDP15yDRwZj8g0iVKEhnugQsw_zWf5gMU2YBev2Eyv4xciJxbhrKCat-X8xNT9SvAbwpY-VxQdu_rnpu1GKCA54DyIX6r-Qh5bQPrrT7NvIupA7jJQ23qq83m4C1cQfBgzlhm7dcCuPqKunYKRsc7NZuER3lT6TjkhsF1qhf7o7BZmCnhz6VuH8L8TwMZS8IJWKSjJd8dEKKwxwPkNXOcZO8A3hIO8SZx4Yd7jrONA",

  },
  "json": null,

  "url": "https://httpbin.org/anything/id_token/anything/id_token"
}
```

That's it! You can now clean up the demo using:

```sh
docker rm -f ory-oathkeeper-demo
docker rmi -f ory-oathkeeper-demo
rm -rf oathkeeper-demo
```

## Monitoring

Ory Oathkeeper provides an endpoint for [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) to scrape as a target. This endpoint can be accessed
by default at: [http://localhost:9000/metrics](http://localhost:9000/metrics):

You can adjust the settings in the Ory Oathkeeper configuration.

```shell
cat << EOF > config.yaml
serve:
  prometheus:
    port: 9000
    host: localhost
    metrics_path: /metrics
EOF
```

Prometheus can be run as a Docker container. More information are available on
[https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus). Start with setting up a Prometheus
configuration:

```shell
cat << EOF > prometheus.yml
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s # By default, scrape targets every 15 seconds.

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'prometheus'
    scrape_interval: 15s
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9090']
  - job_name: 'oathkeeper'
    scrape_interval: 15s
    metrics_path: /metrics
    static_configs:
      # The target needs to match what you've configured above
      - targets: ['localhost:9000']
EOF
```

Run the following commands to start the Prometheus server and access it on [http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090):

```shell
docker run \
  --config.file=/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml \
  -v ./prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml \
  --name prometheus \
  -d \
  --net=host
  -p 9090:9090 \
  prom/prometheus
```

You can extend the basic monitoring setup with visualizations using for example [Grafana](https://grafana.com/). For more
information visit the ["Grafana support for Prometheus"](https://prometheus.io/docs/visualization/grafana/) documentation.

You can use the exemplary dashboard to get started quickly:
[Oathkeeper-Dashboard.json](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/tree/master/contrib/grafana/Oathkeeper-Dashboard.json).
