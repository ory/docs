# Introduction

Welcome to the ORY Keto documentation!

ORY Keto is a service that stores permissions and can answer if an identity is
allowed to perform a certain action over REST. If you came here to answer

- if a certain user is allowed to modify e.g. a blog article
- if a robot is allowed to e.g. print a document

you have come to the right place. If you came here, because your permission
system involves

- complex multi-tenant environments
- permissions based on ownership, ip address, time of day
- or other advanced uses

you are the right place even more so.
