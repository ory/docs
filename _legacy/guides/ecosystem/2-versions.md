# Versioning Semantics

The ORY ecosystem consists of multiple services versioned using
[semantic versioning](https://semver.org). This section explains how we define
service versions and what they mean.

There are two types of services:

- **Graduated services** change rarely in a backwards incompatible fashion. A
  service can be considered graduated if the major version is >= 1 - for
  example: `v1.0.1`, `v2.2.2`. If a serious backwards incompatible change is
  made, the major version jumps one up. Most, if not all, REST APIs will provide
  backwards compatible transformations that make it possible to interact with
  the server using older API concepts.
- **Incubating services** have well defined concepts but do not provide
  backwards compatible REST APIs yet. Incubating services are indicated by major
  version numbers of `0` - for example: `v0.10.0`
- **Sandbox services** may implement concepts, provide APIs and CLIs which are
  not fully baked yet. It is possible that these services change in
  unpredictable ways. These services are indicated by major version numbers of
  `0` and the `sandbox` label - for example: `v0.10.0-sandbox`.

To make deployment easier but stay compatible with semantic versioning, each
service is equipped with a ecosystem version number denoted by `+oryos.X` where
`X` represents the version ecosystem. This is specifically useful when using
incubating or sandboxed services which do not share the version numbers of
graduated services. Let's look at some examples:

- ORY Hydra `v1.0.1+oryos.6` is best compatible with ORY Oathkeeper
  `v0.12.1+oryos.6` and ORY Keto `v0.5.1-sandbox+oryos.6`.
- ORY Hydra `v1.0.2+oryos.7` is best compatible with ORY Oathkeeper
  `v0.12.2+oryos.7` and ORY Keto `v0.6.0-sandbox+oryos.7`.
- ORY Hydra `v1.0.3+oryos.8` is probably not fully compatible with ORY
  Oathkeeper `v0.12.1+oryos.6` nor with ORY Keto `v0.5.1-sandbox+oryos.6`.
- ORY Hydra `v1.1.0+oryos.9` is best compatible with ORY Oathkeeper
  `v1.1.0+oryos.9` and ORY Keto `v1.1.0+oryos.9`.

**Important:** Each release - unless explicitly labeled as `-unstable` - is
going through extensive quality assurance and is considered secure and reliable
enough to be run in production. If you choose to go with an incubating or
sandbox service, it is likely that you will spend some time addressing breaking
changes.

We always provide ways to migrate breaking changes, and all breaking changes are
meticolously described in each project's `UPGRADE.md` as well as `HISTORY.md`.

## Compatibility Matrix

This section will feature a compatibility matrix for each `oryos` in the future.
