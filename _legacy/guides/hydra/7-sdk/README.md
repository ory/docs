# SDK

All SDKs are use automated code generation provided by
[`swagger-codegen`](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen).
Unfortunately, `swagger-codegen` has serious breaking changes in the generated
code when upgrading versions. Therefore, we do not make backwards compatibility
promises with regards to the generated SDKs. We hope to improve this process in
the future.

We encourage you to not use the SDKs (due to mediocre code quality) but to
implement the simple REST calls yourself instead. Most calls can be handled with
one-liners in many languages. In JavaScript you can create a client with:

```
fetch(
    'http://hydra/clients',
    {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {"Content-Type": "application/json"},
        body: JSON.encode({ client_id: 'foo', client_secret: 'bar' })
    }
).then(r => r.JSON())`

**The SDKs do not provide a good API for dealing with OAuth 2.0 Flows (e.g. Authorize Code Flow, Refresh Flow, ...).
But there are tons of [libraries available for consuming OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/code/). Do not write your
own OAuth 2.0 Library!**

If you want to use the SDK despite its caveats (mediocre code quality, potential breaking changes), you will find more information here:

* [Golang](./1-go.md)
* [JavaScript](./2-js.md)
* [PHP](./3-php.md)
